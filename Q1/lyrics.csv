Love Me,Lil Wayne Featuring Drake & Future,2013,"Rap Critic Reviews: “Love Me” by Lil Wayne feat. Drake and Future LyricsHi, I’m the Rap Critic. Well… Lil Wayne has a new single, and it’s called “Love Me”. Well, with a title like that, I don’t know what to expect. However, after “How to Love” turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life, maybe a song titled “Love Me” would be a more personal number. Contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships. And yeah, it could just be another crappy bragging song, but I like to be optimistic when I go into a review. So... what? That’s not the full title of the song? What’s the full title of the song?

Drake: Bitches love me

Man, I feel stupid. Well, let’s get this over with

Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
-stupid, unnecessary audio watermark for the producer-

*sneers*
I don’t know what I was doing-

Wait. What was that thing she’s wearing? Is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle? A mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much? Wow, we’ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory, haven’t we? I mean… you know what, I haven’t even started talking about the lyrics yet. I’m just gonna let this one go

Okay, so this song, which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit, is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex. And…maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff! Like, you know, headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now. Or swing sets. Yeah…

Future: Imma ball ‘til the day I fall

One more thing before we continue. When did this Future character here, a guy who barely passes as a rapper, let alone a singer, become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy? I mean, according to what I’m seeing on the lyric sheet, he has no verse! So without his own full verse, the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook. And I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but…

(shows a cover of the single for “Loveeee Song” by Future and Rihanna as that song plays)

Future isn’t exactly a powerhouse vocalist. I mean, could Lil Wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks? Aren’t you still friends with T-Pain? At least that guy has some personality, this guy is… huh. Funny that a guy named Future is relying on a vocal effect that’s near extinction. I mean, when even T-Pain says...

T-Pain: Auto tune is on its way out!

Back in 2008, I think it’s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously. But back to the song

Drake: Long as my bitches love, my bitches love

Wait, now Drake is on the chorus? Is this the Drake and Future collaboration the world was waiting for? He doesn’t have a verse either, so I can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting. But forgive me again, we need to get back to the song

Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me

So the song is about how he doesn’t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him. Which is typical, but for some reason, in this song he’s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky, confident braggadocio. Actually listen to the song without the arrogant, too cool to care faces in the music video. And really listen to their voices:

I got some down bitches I can call

Is there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess? I mean, if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is, that would be perfect, but it’s not. And usually, failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that’s full of vigor and 808, but he can’t do that here, since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that’s present on nearly every friggin’ song featuring Drake, and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens, their lifeless delivery stops the song dead!

Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me

Does he actually sound convinced here? Does he legitimately sound like he doesn’t care about haters? I don’t know about you guys, but to me it sounds like he’s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve. All I hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess! And we haven’t even gotten to the verses yet!

Lil Wayne: Pussy ass niggas, stop hating

So, you don’t care about haters in any way, shape or form, and only care about your women... but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters. Because you know, what better way to show that you don’t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them?

(montage of Wayne mentioning haters throughout the song)

I don’t know about you, but there’s something slightly contradictory about shouting, “HEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!”

Lil Wayne: Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man!

D-do hoes like Satan? I mean, I know hoes are known for having questionable morality, but I don’t think anyone actively likes Satan. I don’t even think Satanists likes Satan, they just do it to piss off Christians. I mean I know you’re trying to relate the Satan and fire thing, but hoes don’t like fire either!

Lil Wayne: And these hoes love me like Satan, man!

You know, believe it or not, but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that Lil Wayne is part of some demonic cult. And honestly, if you think some post-production CGI inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think Lil Wayne works for the devil... then he does work for the devil... and he’s going to kill you
Lil Wayne: Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she’s on a strict diet

You don’t know how segways work, do you? I mean, what thought process takes you from “I’m going to kill you!” to “This chick is all about my penis.” For real! The only piece of transitional material we get is the word “and”. And I don’t know about you, but linking two phrases together with the word “and” is not the same as a transitional phrase, and I like nipples

Lil Wayne: She don’t want money
She wants the time we could spend

Pfft. Yeah, okay. Lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you!

Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”

Okay… I’m, I’m trying to explain what’s wrong with these lines, and what disturbs me about them. Because it’s not just about the fact that they’re objectifying the girl in question. No, that’s to be expected with Wayne. But it’s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that. And I just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question:

Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”

In what way does this NOT sound like an abusive relationship? In what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who’s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her? I mean it’s not overtly stating it, but it’s definitely implied. (sees a shot of a woman in the scolds bridle) Wow. That is not helping. But anyway, in his episode of Behind the Music, he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him, and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that. If this is true, it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself. And you know what? He’s an artist, and an artist telling you about his perspective doesn't always have to be a positive thing

But my problem lies not in his questionable morals…well actually yes it does, but it’s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular, plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls! I mean, he’s making no bones about the fact that he doesn’t respect you, so at this point, if you’re still trying to get with him, your motivations are probably no better than his, and I think you know what I mean when I talk about the motivations of these types of women. You know, those women, always wanting to spend all of your time…

Lil Wayne: She wants the time we could spend

*scoff* Heartless succubus. But hey, maybe he’s not that bad. Maybe when he’s with these women, he’s actually respectful of the... I’m sorry, are there women in cages like circus animals? So…let me get this straight. Lupe Fiasco makes a song that barely charts, talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects, and should hold themselves to a higher standard, and he’s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff. But Lil Wayne has a top 10 hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages?! With lines like...

Lil Wayne: I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”

And… nobody’s making a stink about this! I’m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything, I just think it’s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on, while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay. But where was I? Oh, yes. So like I was saying, I’m sure in real life, Wayne is very respectful to women…

Lil Wayne: These hoes got pussies like craters

Damn! That…that imagery! Again, to all the women still wanting to have sex with Lil Wayne: THIS is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas! *picture of a crater* So…I think he’s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you’re all whores!

Lil Wayne: Can’t treat these hoes like ladies, man!

Hey…who do you treat like a lady? Because by acknowledging the idea of lady, you’re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status. But none of the girls you’ve ever met have achieved that status in your head. So it’s not that you’re saying that all women are whores; you’re just saying that all women you refer to are whores. Hmm... I wonder how that works for other things

""I’m not saying that all Chinese people are good at math, play piano and know Kung Fu, I’m just saying that all the Chinese people I’m ever going to refer to are good at math, play piano and know Kung-where’s everybody going?""

Lil Wayne: Pussy, money, weed, codeine

Was that a lyric, or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to?

Lil Wayne: She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed: 69, 96

Wait. What do those last numbers have to do with anything? Are you saying that you and her are 69’ing each other? Well that doesn’t work, since you only mention that she’s going down on you! And what is 96 supposed to mean?! Do you know why it’s called 69, Wayne? Because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other. So what is 96 supposed to represent? Two people…facing away from each other? What, are they lying on each other’s butts? That makes no sense!

Lil Wayne: I feel her heartbeat

It’s a little late to get romantic, don’t you think?

Lil Wayne: I chest to chest with this bitch

Yeah, I thought so

Lil Wayne: Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it’s like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses

Hold on a minute, maybe the song’s trying to say something. Maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn’t actually lead to a fulfilling life. And maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet! Of course there’s no real revelation, he just continues to talk about haters and hoes

Lil Wayne: Now kiss my ass if you hatin
I’m getting ass or I’m skating

Anything that keeps you from playing the guitar. *shows a scene of Wayne playing the guitar live* Yeah, keep hitting those two notes, buddy. I’m sure the people who play the Beginner mode on Guitar Hero are impressed

Yeah, overall, this gets a 0 out of 5 from me. The melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song, which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it. And the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat! And his rhymes are terrible. There’s no wordplay here that’s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist. It crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance. And ultimately, does not make for a good listening experience

And that’s pretty much all I have to say about that. Well, I’m the Rap Critic. You don’t have to like my opinion, but I don’t have to like your song

(post-outro scene)
I don’t know about you, but there’s something slightly contradictory about saying, “HEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!” (Someone in the distance: OKAY!"") *chuckles*2Embed"

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet

And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry

But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock

Crooked Smile,J. Cole Featuring TLC,2013,"Crooked Smile Lyrics[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile
[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while

We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

Beware,Big Sean Featuring Lil Wayne & Jhene Aiko,2013,"Beware Lyrics[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying ""Fuck you,"" ""I miss you,"" or ""I hate you so much""
'Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say ""Be real,"" I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying
[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke

I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy (Yup)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in the Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, ""Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?""
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""Ain't no woman like the one I got!""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

We Still In This B****,B.o.B Featuring T.I. & Juicy J,2013,"User-Reviews zu “Underground Luxury” von B.o.B LyricsKillthat187
Als erstes: B.o.B bietet auf diesem Album weder Pop-Brei von 2010 noch seine komischen Genremischungen von 2012 an, und wer ein Comeback des alten B.o.B erwartet, kann auch ziemlich lange warten. Das Album ist eines der besten Storytelling-Rap-Alben 2013 und bei der hammermäßigen Produktion kann auch ein Jay Z oder Kanye West neidisch werden. Hier ein kurzes und knappes Review zu einigen Songs:
Es geht los mit der Promo-Single ""All I Want"" mit einem stark verzerrten und intonierten Intro (""I want bitches, I want cars, I don't give a fuck, I want it all! That's why the fuck we here for!""), welches schon das Thema des ansonsten soliden Songs verrät. Daraufhin folgen ""One Day"" und ""Paper Route"", die den Anfang perfekt vollenden. ""Paper Route"" ist eher gesellschaftskritisch, ""One Day"" wird aus der Perspektive des alten B.o.B gerappt, der von dem träumt, was er jetzt ist/hat, über einen Beat, der sehr an ""Old School Love"" von Lupe Fiasco erinnert, von DJ Frank E. ""Ready"" hab ich schon bei dem ""Ohrwürmer""-Thread gepostet und den Song beschrieben, mehr spar ich mir.
Wer auf Stripclub-Songs steht, ist mit dem fünften Song ""Throwback"" featuring Chris Brown sehr gut bedient. Die beiden rappen über einen großartigen Beat mit einem geloopten 4-Takte-Vocalsample, welches den Song erst großartig macht. Ist lyrisch auf keinen Fall oberklasse, aber frech genug ist diese Single allemal, und nur Bad-Boys können sowas auch in vollen Zügen genießen ;-)

Ab Track 10 geht der eher energische Teil von ""Underground Luxury"" los: Die Leadsingle ""HeadBand"" ist ein Kandidat für die beste Produktion von DJ Mustard, der hier Pfeifklänge und Kickdrums, die so stark sind, dass sie fast den ganzen Song komprimieren, zu einem einprägsamen Beat auf 98 BPM zusammenbastelt. B.o.B rappt mit einer fast schon ignoranten Stimme, während 2 Chainz zwar aggressiver, aber nicht weniger arrogant rappt. Genießt die Bad-Boy-Atmosphäre inklusive sehr hotten Lyrics. HeadBand ist eine rotzfreche Twerking- und Stripclubhymne und jederzeit sommerhittauglich!

""John Doe"" geht wieder in Richtung Gesellschaftskritik und behandelt Drogen- und besonders Alkoholabhängigkeit und hat eine sehr traurige Atmosphäre, die sich in der Klaviermelodie und den verwendeten Effekten wiederspiegelt. Die Hook kommt von Priscilla Renea, die ihr ganzes Talent im Tonumfang unterbringt. B.o.Bs Raptechnik ist deutlich besser als bei einigen vorherigen Songs wie ""Back Me Up"" oder ""Wide Open"".
Einer meiner persönlichen Favoriten ist ""Cranberry Moon Walk"", nicht wegen der (nicht vorhandenen) Lyrik, sondern einfach wegen dem Beat und der gut gesungenen Hook. Wer den Inhalt wissen will, sollte hier auf RapGenius irgendwas von Lil Wayne suchen, den Beat um B.o.Bs Gitarren und den wilden Synthesizern sollte man nicht verpasst haben. Man sollte ""Cranberry Moon Walk"" die Chance lassen, sich zum Geheimfavoriten zu mausern.
Der letzte und 15. Track ist ""We Still In This Bitch"" featuring T.I. und Juicy J, alle drei bringen ihre Verse förmlich um und brillieren mit genialen Wortspielen und Punchlines, sei es B.o.B (""Got all these pounds of ganja, I work out, I'm doing kush-ups""), T.I. (""You want trouble, I got plenty, how you want it, full or semi?"") oder Juicy J (""I got your boo in my boo-gatti, she 'bout to swallow my babies""). Der Beat ist reich an Kick- und Bassdrums und Bässen und spart an der Melodie, heißt: angenehmer Ohrwurmsound. Produktion stammt von Mike WiLL Made It, der das Lied zu einem Clubsong macht, der an Arroganz nicht mehr zu überbieten ist.

Insgesamt ein gutes und harmonisches Genießeralbum für Leute, die auch mal auf die hunderste Reimsilbe kacken können, mit einer Menge Storytelling à la ""good kid, m.A.A.d. city"", aber auch richtig guten, arroganten Songs. Positiv sind außerdem der Ohrwurmfaktor, die Beatauswahl, die Abstimmung der Tracklist und, dass das Album nie langweilig wird und man es überall hören kann. Natürlich nicht perfekt, aber die oben genannten Gründe sind schlagkräftig und machen das Album für mich zu einem besseren als beispielsweise ""Magna Carta Holy Grail"" oder ""Based On a T.R.U. Story II: #MeTime"".

Wie auf B.o.B.s Vorgängeralben leicht verdauliche Pop-Rapmusik garniert mt ein paar ignoranteren Nummern auf netten, basslastigen teils selbst produzierten Beats und auffälligen Features, aber teilweise fragwürdigen und widersprüchlichen Texten. Von “all i want is money” zu “nobody told me money don’t make you rich” zu “girls on the pole yeah they make me rich” ohne erkennbare Struktur und dazu oft unfreiwillig komisch beim Versuch anzugeben:

""Smack on that ass like I know that ho
Wutchu lookin at? Girl you know me, ho it’s me
It’s me, so bust it open for me
This everything that you dreamed of
I’m finna put that ass to sleep""

""I shine bright, I’ll give your girl a slight tan
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man""

""I be the ‘6’, you be the ‘9'
That’s the only time you’ll be less than a dime""
bzw. bei solchen Totalausfällen:

""My girl broke up with me cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her “Wait!
It ain’t what it look like!
I must’ve slip and fell, clumsy me!”.""

Daher ganz klar einer meiner Favoriten des Jahres 2013, auch wenn es mir aufgrund der Abwesenheit der Produzenten Ryan Tedder und Dr. Luke nicht ganz so gut gefällt wie Strange Clouds.2Embed"

Fill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary (Tell 'em)
My vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'
I been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin' (Damn)
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her ass'll knock your ass out, you better stick and move (True)
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling (What?)
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling (Yeah)
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs, so sexy when I'm in-between

Rap God,Eminem,2013,"TranslationsTürkçeไทย / Phasa ThaiРусскийPortuguêsItalianoहिन्दीDeutschFrançaisEspañolCymraegRap God Lyrics[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
You might also like[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed"

The wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
You at war with love, yeah

These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle
[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins ruin me
Arrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding on another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
(Go!) With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover, not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

[Pre-Chorus: Guy Sebastian, (Lupe Fiasco)]
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much (Much)
'Cause I'm the only one that's tryna keep us together (Yeah)
When all of the signs say that I should forget her (Uh-huh)
I wish you weren't the best (Best), the best I ever had (Yeah)
I wish that the good outweighed the bad (Yeah)
'Cause it'll never be over (It'll never be over)
Until you tell me it's over (Until you tell me it's over, yeah)

You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground, screaming ""medic""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

[Pre-Chorus 2: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much (So much)

All Me,Drake Featuring 2 Chainz & Big Sean,2013,"TranslationsEnglishEnglishPortuguêsDrake - All Me (ft. 2 Chainz & Big Sean) (Traduction Française) Lyrics[Produit par Key Wane]

[Intro : Aziz Ansari (tiré du film ""Funny People"")]
""I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy""

[Refrain : Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
[Couplet 1 : 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same, J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

[Refrain : Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Couplet 2 : Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales, I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, then I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!

[Couplet 3 : Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...
[Couplet 4 : Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do1Embed"
High School,Nicki Minaj Featuring Lil Wayne,2013,"High School Lyrics[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne)]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Alright)
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Uh)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, ""Make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

Easy weavin' in and out of the traffic

Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Ridin' into the night, drivin' over the bridge
The same one we'd walk across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school
Candy paint, two-seater
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And rolled on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer

Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hangin' out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steerin' wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished

Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself
[Chorus: Drake]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?

""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
You might also like[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy

Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed"

Trophies,Young Money Featuring Drake,2014,"Rap Genius Trends: 2014 LyricsListening to an album or single is one thing, spending the effort to search, and/or annotate an artists lyrics separates casual listeners from loyal fans. Genius analytics can truly determine who made the biggest impact in a calendar year. So with that in mind, we decided to breakdown lyric driven trends in 2014.Most viewed songs in 20142014 really felt like the year of the ""single"". While we missed major label offerings from the game's hottest MC's, we had an abundance of outstanding singles, features and breakthrough artists. The likes of Bobby Shmurda, Rich Gang, and Rae Sremmurd dropped meme-generating songs quicker than you could understand what Young Thug was saying.  And although Thugger and Rae Sremmurd   may appear more times on the list, Bobby Shmurda took the crown with his single “Hot Nigga”, which  has snagged more than 3,000,000 page views since July last year.

Even with the Young Thugs and Shmurdas in the rap game, fans found themselves furiously searching content from 2012 and 2013. Just under half the songs you'll find below were not from 2014. Most notably, 2013's two rap biggest songs - “Drunk In Love” & “Rap God” sit at the top of our view count. In an even bigger twist, Kendrick Lamar flexed his influence with “m.A.A.d city” - the 8th track from his modern classic good kid, m.A.A.d city broke into the top 10.1. Beyonce ft Jay Z - “Drunk In Love”
2. Eminem - “Rap God”
3. Bobby Shmurda - “Hot Nigga”
4. Rich Gang - “Lifestyle”
5. Beyonce - ""Partition""
6. Drake - “0-100/The Catch Up”
7. Lil Wayne ft. Drake - “Believe Me”

9. Kendrick Lamar ft. MC Eiht - “m.A.A.d city”
10. Big Sean ft. E-40 - “I Don’t Fuck With You”
11. T.I ft.Young Thug - “About The Money”
12. Jhene Aiko - “The Worst”
13. Rae Sremmurd - “No Flex Zone”
14. Childish Gambino - “V. 3005”

16. Rae Sremmurd - ""No Type""
17. Eminem ft. Rihanna - “The Monster”
18. Jay Z ft. Beyonce - “Part II: On The Run”
19. Drake - ""Trophies""
20. Kanye West ft. Charlie Wilson - “Bound 2”Most viewed artists in 2014Song views may rule the roost when it comes to who had the hottest meme of the minute, but an artist is the total package. In 2014, only six of the most viewed artists on Genius released full albums. The most surprising addition to the top ten is Childish Gambino -  seeing his name there with raps heavyweights shows how far he's come from that infamous 1.6.
Drake took 2014's crown as the most viewed artist on Genius - is this a surprise? Yes, for two reasons. The list doesn't include features, and Drake only released a handful of tracks in 2014, meaning he relied heavily on 2013's Nothing Was The Same. It looks like Yeezy was right all along, Drake really is the most popular man in rap.1. Drake

This cements their ""power couple"" brand, but raises more questions about their individual status. Have the ""Beyonce & Jay Z"" brands been replaced by ""The Carters?""

Who Do You Love?,YG Featuring Drake,2014,"Who Do You Love? Lyrics[Verse 1: YG]
I'm that nigga with the plugs
I'm the nigga who got homies that be sellin' drugs
I'm the nigga on the back street
With the fat heat, niggas better run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
My Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Police pull up, I'm tryna stash the Glock
You that nigga on the low-low
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos
Porsche sittin' on Forgi's
Niggas can't afford these
The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 911
I'm the nigga with the juice
But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q

I got a shorty name Texas Syn
She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did ""The Motto"", took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the West like I'm big in the South
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big

In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales, I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, then I just got paid like eight advances

Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working

Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do1Embed"

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend, so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl, why is you lying? Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hol' up

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing, whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand

I don't know why they been lyin' but your shit is not that inspirin'

Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer

I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do

I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl
She been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off

Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's fifteen degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it, though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful, though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left, I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom
[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!

But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit

Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me

Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it

This is my reasons to grind haters talk pay them no mind
If they calling they getting declined
No I'm not wasting no time
Work while I'm up in my prime
No I'm not wasting no time
Ain't no time to waste when there's money to make
Especially on none of these snakes
Now this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
Now this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
Now just tell me just what are your reasons kill him
[Verse 1]
Nothing but fire deriving from Baya
I am not no liar I am rap Messiah the one you admire
The one that will make your favourite rapper consider just to retire
Hungry like Kanye when he wrote the wire rap
Through my lisp though y’all want me to quit
Cause to the money nix told me to hurry
I told him no worries I’m up in the studio cooking no curry
But shooting like Curry dirty just like curry
But shoot more than 30 shoot 81 just like I’m Kobe
Catch you talking shit move you to left like Ginobli
You claiming we homies but move like a phoney like Speaker Knockerz  Rather be on my lonely than being with homies that only call me when I’m popping only call me when I’m popping but when I’m not popping my name you be dropping funny went from being most hated to the one most concentrated on wait I ain’t really done going off might of inspired your favorite poet don’t act like you don’t know it might of inspired your favorite dancer might of inspired your favorite rapper
Rapper or should I say actor
Cause most of these rappers be claiming they trappers
But really be actors just posing as trappers
You really work a 9 to 5 while I'm a lyrical 9
Most of you africans don’t think you can just like Obama
Just because your mama don’t believe in you
See this is the season to drop any reason that in yourself lead you to not be believing all you need is you and God to make it happen though mama don’t believe in your passion see this is my reason to grind our momma’s no they don’t believe in us our daddies they don’t believe in us only us believe in us and in God we trust one day will make it no chances was given we chose to take it and one day we pray to God that we just make it!

[Chorus]
This is my reasons to grind haters talk pay them no mind
If they calling they getting declined
No I'm not wasting no time
See this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
See this is my , this is my

I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crown by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, ""when you blow up, don't forget me"", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete
Been about the money, I ain't worried 'bout the fame
'Bout to have everybody sayin', ""Who Is Rickey Wayne?""

Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in

You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though

Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth

Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms

And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise

Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face

I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man

I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online, that ain't part of my day

I got niggas that can never leave Canada too (Six)

I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well, run up when you see me, then, and we gon' see

Back To Back,Drake,2015,"TranslationsРусскийBack to Back Lyrics[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
[Chorus]
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back

But shit, that's all I was saying
(Money make your girl go down and that's just how it go)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
No keys to crank this Mercedes
I ball like Tracy McGrady
Before that girl touch anything
She gotta say please (Say please)
And I know they really wish we would ball 'til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf, it's a full moon, y'all
Toss the money in the air, girl
Watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait 'til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn, girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibe should be a fuckin' crime
Wastin' someone's time should be a fuckin' crime

Seinfeld: Getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster
And you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal
'Chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, ""What, what's going on here,"" You know?
""Boy this thing is really, really goes high!""
Wale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!'
Seinfeld: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming
Wale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?
Seinfeld: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new. You're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person

If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it

[Verse 1: Wale]
(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote
Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but
[Pre-Chorus 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

We ain't nothin' but some planets

Jerry seinfeld: I always feel like I’m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me.

Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show, I love her just like I love you, and

Wish you could live forever

As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…

""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man

Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental

Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks

Black Widow,Iggy Azalea Featuring Rita Ora,2015,"TranslationsPortuguêsEnglishBlack Widow Lyrics[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing
[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & Iggy Azalea]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
[Chorus: Rita Ora & Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya like a black widow, baby

[Post-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Black, black widow, baby

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doin' whatever works
You ain't ever met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothin' but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 1]
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, ""Where you movin'?"" I said, ""On to better things""

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)

Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love

[Verse 1]


Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you...
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Too Good: Drake ft Rihanna]
[Verse 2]


I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you
If you're okay
My friends always
Feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier
Than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know
How to talk to you
I don't know to be there
When you need me
It feels like the only time you'll see me
Is when you turn your head
To the side and look at me differently
Ohh...
Yeah, and last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night I got as high as your expectations
Last night, oh  came to realization
And I hope you could take it
I hope you could take it all

Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on, ayy, ayy
I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey
[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (goddamn)

Yeh, I know your baby mama fond of me (goddamn)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli (goddamn)
Whispered in my ear, she tryna leave with me (goddamn)

I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

The executive producer, bitch, rest in peace
Then he put his hands in my pants, felt them thick lips, and got wood
He said, ""Kylie, wuss good?"" I said, ""Miley, wuss good?""
I said, ""Could you pay my bills, like O'Reilly? Wuss good?""
I just sit back and observe, all these niggas that I done curved
If it go down in your DM, then baby boy, you lucky
Cause 99.9%, of these fuckboys can't fuck me

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I seen your man post a quote, and a pic in bed
So I hit him in the DM, like, ""Hey bighead
'Member when I was your woman crush?"", He said, ""Yeah""
Told him that I'm headed home, he could meet me there
Try to beat me there, let me be clear
Is you eatin' ass too? Nigga, pinky swear
I'm just lookin' for a dude, that could eat the twat
Do he make more dough, than the pizza shop?
Do he dress every day, like it's Easter Sunday?
Can he give me more head, than Peggy Bundy?
Man, fuck I look like turnin' down some dome?
Man that's sorta like a dog turnin' down some bone
Nigga know that I'm a 10, that's Celine on my lens
I don't need another friend, it's just me and my Ms
I said, ""What you like about me?"" He said, ""That your ass fat""
He said, ""Would I let him eat this ice cream out my ass crack?""
He said that it's abstract, he said, ""Yo, yo ass crack!""
I told him ""I'm never frontin',"" then I threw that ass back

You see the wings on every pair

21 Grammys that I use for D'USSÉ cups
I'm on the penthouse floor, call your way up
The OG's say, ""HOV, how high is high enough?""
I said, ""Till we eye and eye with the higher-ups""
Until we let 'em know, we ain't those niggas
Until our babies showered in gold, nigga

Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek

When yo' bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it

Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it (Not make it), I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it (Not make it), I might not make it

[Verse 2: Belly]
Bitches know, told a ho, ""It's different strokes for different folks""
Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
Took my niggas from the 401 to Pacific Coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishing boat
Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke (L-Liquor, smoke)
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough (Dick and dough)
Told her, ""You don't gotta make it difficult""
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion (Yeah)
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes is Christian (Yeah)
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired (Haha)

Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping

Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco

I told moms I ain't trippin' over school cause I made it
Said, ""Boy you got a son, supposed to be his inspiration""
Put a milli' in his bank account
Don't leave him out I was thinkin'
I'll never do him wrong like they did the operation
Took a nigga's vision from him, was a mothafuckin' baby
Said a couple years later they can give it back to me
Technology is movin' too slow, I'm waitin' patiently
Shit, I don't want it no more, this how I'm meant to be
Remember young kids in the school used to laugh at him
Guess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics
Niggas broke and Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?
Man I bought about 12 cars just to blast past 'em
Switch cars so much, they don't know which one to blast at
And my bitch so bad and you know her ass fat
Wanna ride through and they is who I'll laugh at
Zoo Gang my crew, won't put nothin' past that

Everything automatic but I know it matter

Back up off me, back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me

[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
Oh yah yah bitch, back up off me
You don't know me, I'm too clean, I'm too holy, bitch I'm godly
I only go for real niggas who don't brag 'bout what they bought me
Cause they know I got a bag, gotta fuck me up some commas
If I fuck and make you cum, you got to promise not to stress me
Don't be blowin' up my phone and don't be leavin' voice messages
Sayin' ""I can do you right, do you better than your exes""
I told that nigga to stop it, he was talkin' out his necklace
See the difference with me, I never needed niggas, ever
I'll leave 'em where I met 'em, I ain't trippin' off no extras
Goons in the cut try to talk you out your necklace
If you ever disrespect me, pussy, don't be disrespectful
I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
He heard about me, he was waitin' on me at the door
I said woo, yeah that mink all on the floor
Used to bust this shit at skatin', 6 to 9, come in at 4
We got glow sticks for you ho chicks, bitch don't act like you don't know this
I'm very antisocial, social network ain't my motion (I don't move like that)
I show no emotions, nigga's bitches it's disgustin'
Bananas with the Trojans, pop that pussy for a legend
[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Back up off me, they want my backs in coffins
It's so cold in the D and they still wanna take my jacket off me
Back when I couldn't afford to get it mixed and mastered, homie
My mama fronted me that money so it's no backup, homie
Bitch so back up off me
Bank account look like a ballot, homie, yeah it's checked up
My niggas packin', you get to trippin', they unpackin', homie
Yeah I overdo it, yeah that's salad, homie
Yeah I'm overdressed and ain't no salad on me
Me and DeJ together, holy matrimony
Yohhh, it's hard to smile and shit
When they ain't free Juan, I got real ones on trial and shit
Fuck all my peers unless we talkin' bout Belle Isle and shit
The check is seven figures, I might try and dial the shit
And if I fuck and make you cum, don't be blowin' up my phone
Lately I've been messin' with girls who tend to own shit on their own
I turn dusk into dawn, turn my chair to a throne
Fuck her off in the whip, make her take Uber home
Cold to the chromosome, I grew up without a hammock
I did everything except panic, feel me? Finally Famous the family
And we expandin' on the top floor like we tannin'
She throwin' tantrums
She gon' hold this dick like a Grammy
I give her bomb D and do damage, she like...

Geri dönüyoruz, seksek falan oynadığımız günleri hatırla? (seksek)
Mahalleyi polisler kontrol ederken geri çekilmemi söyleyen sendin (polisler)
Sen uyandığında hayallerini gerçekleştireceğim (hayallerin)

Annene uğradım, neyden yapıldığını görmeliyim (anan)
Onların paralarını umursamak zorunda değilsin benimkiler üstümde
Benim hayatıma girebilirsin o ün otobüsüne binmen gerek (skrt)
Çünkü söz veriyorum dışarı çıktığımızda ünlü olacaksın

Ayağa kalkıp koca götünü Gucci pantolonuma koydu
Labelımız yok
Şişeler istediğini söyledi, masamız yok
Yatağının çerçevesi yok, masaları yok
Netflix izliyorduk, kablo tvsi yokmuş, pekala
Fiş, fiş, fiş, ben onu şarj ederim
Saçlarından tutup kapıyı onun için tutan bir zenciyi arzuluyor

Şimdiye kadar ki en iyisiyim, ama en iyim henüz gelmek üzere
Çünkü ben birilerini arıyordum
Sıradan bir sikiği değil
Birilerini öldürmeme sebep olma
Bu herhangi biri ve herkes için
Oh, Tanrım! Bana her gün yazıyor, cevap alamıyor
Kaltak, tepemi attırıyorsun
Bu altını bronza çevirmek gibi bir şey, gözlerimi deviriyorum
Ve o Molly kullandığı zaman zombiye dönüşüyor
O bizim Clyde ve Bonnie olduğumuzu düşünüyor
Tanrım, beni affet! Tunechi F akıyorum, ben bir efsaneyim
Dosdoğru Crescent'tan
Bebeğini Essence'a uçuruyorum
Kayıtlara geçsin, Khaled'i rekorlar kırdığında tanıyordum
Mula Gang, rekoru kazanıyoruz
Eski sevgilililerimin üstünde akıyorum, oh Tanrım!

Ich werde den Rhythmus bekommen
Während sie gegen mich drückt, ooh, ist sie angeschwipst?

Ich gucke dich durch den ganzen Raum an
Schöner kleiner Körper, tanzt wie Gogo, hey
Und du bist unvergessbar
Ich muss dafür sorgen, dass du alleine bist (oeh)
Warum nicht? Eine verdammt gute Zeit hat noch niemanden geschadet
Ich hab einen kleinen Drink, aber es nicht Barcadi
Wenn du das Mädchen liebtest, tut es mir sehr, sehr leid
Ich muss es ihr geben als wären wir in einer Ehe
Oh, als wären wir in Eile
Nein, nein, ich werde es niemanden erzählen

Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys

I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need them (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)

Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)
[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos

Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins (Wer kann es verstehen? Wouh)
Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

[Hook: Logic]
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will heute einfach sterben
Ich will einfach sterben
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will einfach sterben
Und lass mich dir sagen warum
[Part 1: Logic]
All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft
Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts
Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen
Ich hatte nie einen Ort, den ich mein Eigen nennen konnte
Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause
Keiner ruft mein Handy an
Wo warst du? Wo bist du? Was geht in dir vor?
Sie sagen jedes Leben ist wertvoll, doch interessiert sich für meins

[Pre-Hook: Logic]
Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins (Wer kann es verstehen? Wouh)

Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

Ich will, dass du lebendig bist

Du musst heute nicht sterben
Du musst nicht sterben
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist

Du musst heute nicht sterben

Wenn dein Kopf im Wasser untergegangen ist
Und die Leichtheit in der Luft
Wenn du da bist

Es ist Weitermachen, auch wenn der Weg lang ist
Und Licht in den dunkelsten Dingen zu sehen
Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst
Endlich zu wissen wer es ist
Ich weiß, dass du Gott danken wirst, dass du es getan hast

[Part 3: Logic]
Ich weiß wo du warst, wo du bist, wohin du gehst
Ich wieß, dass du der Grund bist, warum ich ans Leben glaube
Was ist der Tag mit einer kleinen Nacht?
Es kann schwer sein
Es kann so schwer sein
Aber du musst jetzt leben
Du musst jetzt alles geben

Ich will heute nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben

[Outro: Khalid]
Schmerz tut nicht so weh, ich weiß
Die Spur, die ich fahre, fühlt sich einsam an
Aber ich bewege mich bis meine Beine aufgeben
Und ich sehe meine Tränen im Schnee schmelzen
Aber ich will nicht weinen
Ich will nicht mehr weinen
Ich will mich lebendig fühlen
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben
Oh ich will nicht
Ich will nicht
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterbenEmbed"

Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit

But I hear him every time, mane

If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory

Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up

Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides

Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the .9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine, huh

Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Mu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?
With vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle

Ayy, JR, nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened? (We did that bitch, nigga)
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders

You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him

So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on

No Heart,21 Savage & Metro Boomin,2017,"TranslationsPortuguêsPolskiEspañolTürkçeNo Heart Lyrics[Intro]
Southside, Southside on the, Southside on the, hey
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon
[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one
Savage, I ain't even hatin'""
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage, I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up

Don't get close to me
Hugging my Rosary

The Honda Accord
Daddy would stunt
He would pull up at ac

Back I use to put on the throwback
Back when I use to just play the backcourt
Back when  I use to wear the jansport

Don't act like she booshie as fuck
I told her
Go listen to Gucci instead
I got me a yella
She bump the Kodak
I met her miami
That night in the sand
I told her to read all the signs in my hand
She told me the vision was safe and clear
She wanted a Kodak
A pic from the gram
She told me I was becoming a man
The picture Was only because I'm the man
I was just a baby boy
Getting picked up at the crib
Getting dropped off at my school

10 dənə əla fahişə var malikanəmdə
Üzərimdəki almazlar Milly Rock edir
Çox çalışdığım zaman pul çoxalmağa başlayır
Məni yalamaq istəyən model fahişələr var
Və narkotik işi bitir
Soyadım Savage, amma adım Randy deyil
Onunla qorunmadan oluram, ona doğum kapsulu içirtdim
Və mən Kodein içirəm, Brendi yox

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Hah (Hah) Sadəcə eksimə hava atıram (Hah)
Huh (Gözlə) Sadəcə eksimə göstəriş edirəm (Hah)
Gözlə, sadəcə eksimə hava atıram (Gözlə)
Gözlə (Gözlə), sadəcə eksimə göstəriş edirəm
Rədd elə üzüyü, aldım özümə boyunbağı (21, 21)
Almazlar o qədər əladır ki, onları tuta bilməzsən (21, 21)
Onu evdə tək qoydum, çünki özünü bir şey zənn edir (Hah, woah)
Bütün fahişələr əsəbidir, mənə dayana bilmirlər (Hah, woah)

Sadəcə eksimə göstəriş edirəm sadəcə, gözlə (göstəriş edirəm)

Onun rəfiqəsi yalayacaq məni ""fruit roll up"" kimi
Hisslərini 'gram-da paylaşır, bir az boyu *Bandz*
21, fahişəyə göstəriş edirəm sadəcə, bir dəqiqə
Fahişənin mesajına cavab filan vermirəm, bir dəqiqə
O fahişəyə görə stresə girməyəcəm, bir dəqiqə
21 alacaq əlinə silahını, bir dəqiqə
Bir dəqiqə, bir dəqiqə, pul qazanmağı sevirəm fahişə
Bir dəqiqə, bir dəqiqə, saç əlavələriniz olmasa keçəlsiniz
Bir dəqiqə, evinin kirayə pulunu mən alış-verişdə xərcləyirəm
Özünə yeni bir zənci tapıb, zənci isə yoxsul, uduzan yenə də o
Bir dəqiqə, bu özəl yerdə
Bir dəqiqə, onu daimi fırlanmağa göndərdim
Bir dəqiqə, fırlandığım fahişələrin hamısı köçkün
Bir dəqiqə, tərcümə ilə danışırıq indi

The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""

Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves

The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you

Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement

You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram

And we all in black, like it's Gangland

Das ist TR3YWAY!
König von New York, sucht nach der Königin
Ah, du hast die Richtige
L-Lass es diese-l-lass es diese S-S-Schlampen wissen, Nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, prr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Part 1: 6ix9ine]
Muschi ist nass, nass, und es tropft, tropft
Ist eine Spritzpistole, fick sie, sie ist ein Fefe
Ihr Name Keke, sie bläst meinen Schwanz als sei er gratis, gratis
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich das getan?“
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich sie gefickt?“
Ich weiß nur, dass ich sie nicht zu meiner Frau machen kann
Bin nett zu ihr, damit sie sich nicht wehrt
Drehe um und fick es von hinten, hinten, hinten
Beuge sie runter und lass es klatschen, klatschen, klatschen
[Hook: 6ix9ine]
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde, nein

[Part 2: 6ix9ine]
Draco hat den Rückstoß, wenn ich schieße, werden sie zu Leichtathleten
Sie schießen nicht zurück, ein Schuss, Nahdistanz, roter Punkt
Kopf platzt, ja, ich hab's getan, ja, das ist mein Leben
Rufe einen Uber mit meinen Schützen, mit einem Ruger, wir erledigen dich
Typen sagen, sie töten Leute, doch ich tu es wirklich

Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde, nein

Shoutout an A$AP, halte mich mit Diamanten bestückt, ich komme aus New York, also bin ich frech
Sagt, er mag meine Bande, kaufte mir Chloé wie Kardashi
Hält meine Muschi in Versace, sagte ich bin schön so wie Tinashe
Halt-Halte es alles in sein Gesicht, wurde ich angeklagt?
Soeben ist jemand meinem Pussy-Game erlitten, doch ich hinterlasse nie eine Spur
Gesicht so schön, Arsch langt für Tage, ich bekomme Chips, ich frage nach Lay's
Ich lehne mich nur zurück, wenn er fertig ist und frage, „Wie hat es geschmeckt?“

My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I —
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever

Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga
[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt

Lemon,N*E*R*D & Rihanna,2018,"Natural Born Kickeur III LyricsC'est pas un drame si j'atteins pas l'platine
Les rappeurs mentent, ils ont l'jeu d'acteur de Palpatine
En bas d'chez moi ça baroude, j'dirais plutôt ""ça barrode""
Déjà rentré des patates, déjà rentré des carottes
Des grosses voitures, voilà l'image qu'on véhicule
J'ai plongé dans l'illicite, les études comme pédiluve
La vie m'a fait de grands dégâts, je valais rien au top départ
Aujourd'hui j'fais ma vendetta, casse des bouches et tape des barres
J'arrive, bibendum, se-pha dans le barillet
Si j'déménage, peut-être que mes thèmes pourront varier
Paris est pas si magique, veux-tu parier
Des mecs de tess avec des sapes de marque et les dents cariées
T'as fait ci, t'as fait ça, ta té-ci n'est pas si sale
J'apprécie pas ton rap, que des bêtises abyssales
Là où j'vis, même les raclis veulent des couilles en or
J'encaisse les thunes et les coups, pas du clan des couillonneurs
Ceux qui sont pas contents n'ont qu'à s'lever
Dans la rue, si tu manques de flair, on te casse le nez
La punchline est complète, aucune demi-mesure
Si j'te dis qu't'es hors compète, tu réponds ""oui monsieur""
L'idéal : veski les keufs et la mettre aux meufs
Jamais tué personne, comme un neuf millimètres neuf
M'égaler, ceux qui le croient sont bé-chtar
Y en a très peu à ma taille, comme les jeans à G-Star
J'ai enterré mes rêves de gosse devant le zapping
On pleure plus en public, même si parfois ça pique
Ils nous diabolisent, c'est qu'un vice de plus
On est des enfants d'la télé, eux des fils de pute
Torrent d'cyprine quand ta bitch entend mon nom
2012, le ton a durci, j'mets du vin dans mon eau
Le peura ça vend pas, n'écoute pas c'qui s'évente
Deux-mille téléchargements, enlève deux zéros pour les ventes
Toujours pas au goût des élégantes dames
La vraie beauté est intérieure, à part pour Elephant Man
Allez nique ta race, toi et tes r'frains chantonnés
Ça sort les teilles de champagne, leur public boit du Champomy
Coffee G., on ouvre les portes avec des clés d'bras
Tes blessures, c'est rien, comparé à nos plaies d'braves
Casserole sur la plaque, méfiez-vous de l'eau qui dort
Ma fierté ne s'achète pas, même contre des lokis d'or
Tise et drogue, malheureusement c'qui fait tourner l'four
Triste époque, le marchand d'sable passe au Redbull
J'voulais graisser les épinards, mais téma le prix d'la crème
J'ai vu les grands faire du blé, alors j'en ai pris d'la graine
On s'en sert peu, on vient remettre le couvert
Levez les majeurs, moi j'm'en bats les reins des pouces verts
Piano-zouk-électro, les mecs de tess m'ont déçu
Y'aurait des strings Prada, ils se jetteraient tous dessus
Visent la plus belle, chouf un peu à quoi ça mène
Amène les camions-poubelles, beaucoup trop de sacs à merde
Provoque pas trop, même si j'ai le cœur à Coluche
Avant qu'je sorte les griffes, on me prenait pour une peluche
Pas de grand public, uniquement des chrysanthèmes
J'élargirai pas mon boule pour élargir ma clientèle
Manque de nettoyage, les nuls se banalisent tant
N'importe qui s'incruste, comme en Afghanistan
Sois tranquille, on se charge d'écumer
Les rappeurs veulent me mettre un patch pour que j'arrête de les fumer
Peu importe la couleur, ensemble on fait des merveilles
On saigne tous, notre rap est dans la même veine
Blanc, jaune, métissé, couleur ébène
La route est longue entre le square Léon et le jardin d'Éden
Dérange pas si ça dîne, les concurrents, j'les abîme
Je prends du poids, les asticots se lèchent les babines
Baise les nouveaux puristes, jeunes mais déjà séniles
Ils écouteraient même du Bieber, du moment qu'c'est sur vinyle
J'ai changé depuis la dernière fois
J'suis pas une star, j'fais couler l'sang, le tapis rouge, il est derrière moi
Pessimiste, avec quelques sautes d'humour
Recule de quelques pas, y a qu'mes poignées qui sont d'amour
Ton buzz est dead, et ta cote se meurt
J't'anéantis en un clin d'œil, à la Scott Summers
Trop de bâtards, j'demande qu'à les achever
Pour les compter sur mes doigts, y m'faudrait le corps à Shiva
Le rôle de l'antihéros, chaque cité a son barde
On a des gueules de terros, avec ou sans la barbe
Demande pas si ça roule à un brancardier
Mon arrondissement est riche, contrairement à mon quartier
J'ai le blues de l'école ""Hoochie Coochie Man""
Viens pas demander un feat' si t'as le flow à Gucci Mane
Chez moi, y a que les Marocains qui partent au Maroc
Poésie baroque, gris et solide comme un roc
Pas sérieux, ça baise des 'tasses pas très malignes
J'écrirais pas comme ça sans garder cette adrénaline
T'avais juré d'arrêter, mais tu la tires d'un trait la ligne
Personne n'a témoigné de ce qui s'passe après la vie
Appelle-moi Toubab Shakur, a.k.a. l'baron
J'leur mets tellement de gifles qu'ils m'confondent avec le daron
Belek à ma big team, baise tout et casse les murs
T'es qu'une victime, même sur Facebook, tu rases les murs
C'est qu'on est pas passés par là si tu vois pas d'sang
T'avais prévu d'exploser, j'ai entendu qu'un clac-doigt
T'avais du buzz, t'as flambé, t'as vendu quatre-cent
T'arrêtes pour raison religieuses, allez casse-toi
Y a les statues géantes et y a les figurines
Y a ceux qui grattent des seize mesures et ceux qui grattent des featurings
Ceux qui lâchent un son par an et ceux qui saignent à l'usine
Ceux qui accusent la distrib' et ceux qui améliorent leur musique
J'vise pas l'oscar, propos limites
Ça m'est égal que la critique ma taille une pipe ou un costard
J'étais juste venu boire, ils m'ont fait trinquer
Mutilation du track, tu kiffes pas, t'es détraqué
Rangez vos albums, c'est d'la qualité bootleg
Leur son tourne en rond, et le mien tourne en boucle
Ça sonne sale malgré la qualité sonore
Chaque mesure fait mal, tu vas valider l'ceau-mor
Que des joueurs de trompette, sortez les cuivres
J'me renseigne sur les modes pour être sûr de pas les suivre
Grosse merde, crari tu fréquentes les hautes sphères
Ferme un peu ta grande gueule, tu pollues mon atmosphère
Ton flow est sucré, moi j'utilise des mots amers
Le rap sans moi, comme une cité sans famille Mohamed
Tu loues des Ferrari, alors qu'tu roules en Lada
J'vais pas viser ta tête, vu qu'elle te sert à nada
Ni le tiékar ni la Lune, j'vise la galaxie
J'me prends pas pour un Noir, nique le Galak
Si ça fonctionne pas, j'passe au rock à la Barrett Syd
Mes potes sont des vrais, pas des gratteurs de garette-ci
Ça cherche des méthodes pour du talent, pourtant y en a pas quarante
T'as vendu ton âme au diable, apparemment tu t'es fait carotte
Tu pues la défaite, que des phases pour gamines
Et tu fais plus de name-dropping que Raito Yagami
Ceux qui ont le moins sont ceux qui montrent le plus
Le temps passe aussi vite sur une montre de luxe
Je danse pas, je mate les culs, près d'la buvette
Me parle pas d'vécu, j'ai vu plus de merde qu'une cuvette
Ma mission : tuer les faux, bien sûr dédicacer les bons
Mon flow est lourd, il a peur de traverser les ponts
Ils veulent ma mort, j'les vois en face, ils s'mettent en r'trait
PD, tu vas rien faire, va jouer aux fléchettes sur mon portrait
Je rappe mieux qu'toi, c'est une certitude
Essaie de nous maquer, tu vas connaître la servitude
Qui veut voler mon or, mon art
La rondelle en bon état, y a qu'à la science que j'peux donner mon corps
Tu sais qui c'est, pas b'soin de répétition
Dis c'que tu veux, j'écouterai pas, t'es comme le diététicien
Tout c'qui m'sépare des mecs en major, c'est le manque de sous
Les beatmakers, avis à vous, braqueur de banques de sons
J'amène du sang frais, j'attire les piranhas
T'as testé, t'as mérité ta gifle comme Rihanna
C'est pas du hard rock, mais j'veux voir des pogos
Si c'était moi qu'avait croqué, Apple n'aurait plus d'logo
J'ai violé l'instru, j'ai ma place au PS
Tu critiques mais tu branles rien, comme le prof d'EPS
Le rap a pécho l'HIV, ce titre est là pour l'achever
Ne pas déranger, j'écris votre futur album de chevet
Cevi t'es gang, t'es inconnu en tess
Tu vas en voir de toutes les couleurs comme une shneck hollandaise
Sur ma tête pas d'auréole, tout sauf malléable
Représente les halls, sûrement pas les Halles
J'perds mon temps à espérer que jamais mon réveille sonne
Gratter des putain d'phases écoutées par cinquante personnes
Ça bicrave pour grailler autre chose que des döners
C'est pas une question d'bonheur, c'est une question d'honneur
C'est pas d'la snap, Bazoo jamais loin du snack
Des envies d'autodafé dès que j'mets les pieds en Fnac
Ils parlent de Merco, j'connais l'numéro d'bus de ces tomis
Habitué d'la street, j'ai chauffé l'banc, plus que Citony
Joue pas l'cow-boy, sinon tu finis scalpé
L'union fait la force, à part pour ton équipe de dalepés
Avant d'lâcher ma passion, je périrai
Si le rap se montre patient, j'le guérirai

I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

That money be callin'
I don't do no talkin', so get the fuck outta my face
Got a TEC and a chopper
With a hundred thousand dollars up in the Wraith
You know I ain't slippin', you know that I'm with it
I'll shoot him right up in his face
3Three say that I'm trippin', you know that I'm drippin'
I'm wrapped in Saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from God, I ain't put it on yet
I don't care 'bout no bitch, I ain't giving her shit
Spend it all on my homies
I go put on my son, from my car to my house
Everything, I own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stuntin'
I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin', you know I won't fight him
My clip full of thunder, you know that I'll strike 'em
Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body

Got rid of my Glock and I bought me a rifle

River,Eminem Featuring Ed Sheeran,2018,"TranslationsEnglishTürkçeРусскийEnglishEminem - River ft. Ed Sheeran (ترجمه ی فارسی)TürkçeEminem - River ft. Ed Sheeran (Deutsche Übersetzung) Lyrics[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

[Part 1: Eminem]
Er kommt heim mit zerkratztem Hals, um Kritik einzustecken
Sweatjacke und Anzughose, nicht zusammenpassend
In seinem Atem Jack, er ist ein Sexsüchtiger
Und sie möchte nur Rache üben und zurückkommen
Es ist ein Schachspiel, sie ist hinter ihm her wie ein Jetpack
Sie behält die Übersicht über all seine Internetchats
Und ratet, wer gerade dabei ist, zur Nächsten weiterzuziehen
Tatsächlich, gerade auf mein letztes Mädchen gekackt und sie hat, was meiner Ex fehlt
Denn sie liebt Gefahr, Psychopath
Und du fickst mit niemandes Mädchen, selbst ich weiß das
Aber sie hat einen Plan entwickelt, ihm in den Rücken zu stechen
Messer in der Hand, sagt, dass ihre Beziehung an einer Strähne hängt
Also war sie neuerdings im Netz
Sagt, vielleicht wird sie meine Gwen Stacy sein, um ihren Mann zu ärgern
Und ich weiß, sie benutzt mich, um zu versuchen, ihn zu betrügen, mir egal
Hi Suzanne, aber ich hätte sagen sollen: „Bye Suzanne“
Nach der ersten Nacht, aber heute Nacht bin ich
[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

[Bridge: Eminem]
One-Night-Stand, wurde zu einem Two-Night-Stand
Es war „Komm, Sonnenlicht, verschwinde“, jetzt umarmen wir uns fest und...

[Part 2: Eminem]
Er hat es rausgefunden, jetzt fühlt sie sich verlassen und benutzt
Denn er ist abgehauen, na und? Er hat es ihr außerdem zuerst angetan
Wie soll ich jetzt diesem Mädchen sagen, dass wir fertig sind?
Es ist hart, die Worte zu finden, ich bin reserviert, nervös, und Sue
Möchte nicht, dass das wehtut, aber was du verdienst ist die Wahrheit
Nimm es nicht persönlich, ich kann es dir einfach nicht persönlich sagen
Also kehre ich ins Studio zurück, wie Rattenloch-Diner
Muss in einer Kabine nicht reserviert sein
Ich fühle mich nur so, als wäre die Person, zu der ich werde
Unumkehrbar, ich habe auf dich Jagd gemacht, als wäre es Kirche auf der Kirchenbank
Und jetzt, wo ich dich habe, will ich dich nicht
Nutzte den Vorteil in meinem Verfolgungsdurst
Warum mache ich diesen Dreck, den ich mache?
Steige auf meine Tribüne und predige meine Predigt und Rede
Reinigungsmittel und Bleiche verbrennen die Wunde
Denn jetzt, mit ihr im Mutterleib
Können wir sie nicht in diese Welt bringen, hätten daran denken sollen
Schutz zu verwenden, bevor ich in deine verbotene Frucht gebissen habe
Fuck!

[Part 3]
Immer die Brautjunger, niemals „die Braut, hey“
Was zum Teufel soll ich sagen? Wenn das Leben eine Schnellstraße wäre
Und Betrug eine Enklave, würde ich über fünf Fahrspuren schlingern
Die Geschwindigkeit ist enorm, als würde ich auf Eis rutschen, vielleicht
Ist das, warum ich dich vielleicht von der Seite angemacht habe
Ich kann meine Lügen nicht beisammen halten
Aber ich brachte dich dazu, mein Baby aufzulösen
Diese Dreiecksbeziehung ließ uns im Ruin zurück, verwirrt
Was kann ich noch sagen? Es hat eine Zeit lang Spaß gemacht
Wette, ich hätte dein Lächeln wirklich geliebt
Wollte nicht wirklich abtreiben, aber scheiß drauf
Was ist eine Lüge mehr, die wir unserem ungeborenen Kind erzählen?
[Refrain: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen

I met her miami
That night in the sand
I told her to read all the signs in my hand
She told me the vision was safe and clear
She wanted a Kodak
A pic from the gram

Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days
[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

[Bridge: Kesha]
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change

This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)

Had to hit my old town to duck the news

Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew

Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

ZEZE,Kodak Black Featuring Travis Scott & Offset,2019,"TranslationsEnglishKodak Black - ZEZE ft. Travis Scott & Offset (Tradução em Português) Lyrics[Tradução de ""ZEZE"", de Kodak Black, Travis Scott & Offset]

[Intro]
D.A. tem aquela droga!

[Refrão 1: Travis Scott]
Água gelada, virou Atlântica (Congelou)
De noite em um Phantom (Skrrt, Skrrt)
Falei pra essas putas não entrarem em pânico
Tomei uma ilha, (Yeah) inundou a mansão (Muita água)
Abaixei o teto, mais expansão
Dirija um carro em que você possa ficar (It's lit)
Vejo as vadias cobertas (Nos lençóis)
Eu sou um amante de bundas e peitos (Bunda grande)
Acho que todos nós fizemos um pro outro
Agora que todos os parças estão livres (Yeah, yeah)
E estamos fora nessas ruas (Tudo bem)
Você pode fazer isso, você pode rebolar pra mim?
[Refrão 2: Kodak Black]
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)

[Verso 1: Offset]
Offset!
Explodi os miolos do carro (Boom)
A polícia quer falar, mas eu tô no mudo (Woo-woo, hey)
Vou cravejar o pulso dela porque ela é fofa (Ice, ice)
Transo com ela em um iate, mergulho numa piscina (Yeah)
Ela é viciada (Viciada), viciada pelo estilo de vida e pelo Patek (Patek)
Paizão, você já sentiu os tecidos da Chanel? (Chanel)
Vou ser estiloso até a morte, preciso de um caixão (Estiloso)
E temos mais listras do que o árbitro, ele falta, TEC nele (Bow, listras)
No meio do campo igual o David Beckham (Campo, bow-bow)
Todos os meus manos presos, de verdade, tô tentando ajudá-los (Liberdade, Liberdade)
Quando eu ganhei um milhão, me deu arrepios, não sei o que aconteceu (Hoo, arrepios)
Tomo pílulas, faço o que eu quero, eu tô naquele zumbi (Hey, hoo)
Eu sou mais o Gaddafi, não sou nenhum Gandhi (Gaddafi, hey)
Eu sou mais o David, Golias correndo (Hey, hey)
Os manos são clonados, eu acho engraçado (Clone, haha)
Somos do Nawf, direto da masmorra (Somos do Nawf, hey)
Eu vou na boca dela, ela não pode me dizer nada (Eghck, eghck, egchk)
300, o relógio tá fora do seu orçamento (Woo, woo, 300)
A maldade me pegou
Yeah, e essa arma saiu direto da Rússia

[Verso 2: Kodak Black]
Em um Hellcat porque eu fui criado no inferno
Homem feito, eu não devo favor pra nenhum mano
Quando você conseguir esse dinheiro, mano, mantenha seu coração
Eu tô deslizando no carro, não precisa de chave pra ligar
Eu levo a arma comigo no BET Awards
Quando seu poço secar, você sabe que precisa de mim pra isso
Quando eu estaciono no Buick, você sabe o que tô fazendo
Se a polícia ficar atrás de mim, eu vou fugir e vazar
Dormindo na paleta me transformou em um selvagem
Eu sou um bebê do projeto, agora moro em Calabasas
Como se eu ainda servisse aos demônios, como se ainda estivesse afirmando
Eu tô bebendo lean, tento manter o equilíbrio
Andando naquela Z-Walk, Dickie's com meus Reeboks
Eu não falo muito, apenas deixo a arma falar
Suas joias mexem na água, diamantes tipo re-rock
Minha mina cavalga no pau como se tivesse numa gangorra
Quando eu entrei na cena, eu tava com uma mira
Quando eu entrei na Beam', eu tava de Celine
Garotinha, você é apenas uma aventura, não é isso que quero dizer
Dinheiro pulando pra fora do meu jeans, igual eu faço o esquema
[Refrão 2: Kodak Black]
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)

Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave
[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor

Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Just say to me what you want from me

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

[Refrain]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Verse 3]
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin

Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, said I was gettin' some head, get-gettin' some head
Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, have them hype up in the 6
If she dead, let her lay, won't bring no life into this bitch
Lookin' this good should be a sin, you should call me cinnamon
Cardi B, bad bitch, those is fuckin' synonyms
We see who winnin' (See who winnin'), we see who got it (See who got it)
You see I'm still in the bank makin' deposits (Cash)
You see who switched up sides and who was solid (Who was solid)
You see who stuck to the code and who forgot it
Talk about it, bitch

Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I’m changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin’ like I’m gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—
[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

Alguém que possa te satisfazer

Ela me deixou estressado, cantando melodias
Por ela eu juro que cometeria um crime
Oh, Penelope

Life Is Good,Future Featuring Drake,2020,"TranslationsРусскийPortuguêsFrançaisLife Is Good Lyrics[Part I]

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush
[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up

Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us

Tornato con il remix
Questi ragazzi tutti miei figli come Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
La mia città e il mio stato non hanno mai visto questo
Jimmy Neutron, sono un ragazzo prodigio (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Sul futon, le sto dando quel cazzo
Quando questa merda è pronta, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, come Gilbert Arenas, sparo il colpo
Sono ancora con i demoni, ooh, I keep it thorough
Ho cinque tipe a New York
Questo significa una in ogni quartiere
Sono nel pocket come Burrow
Quando sono tornato a casa, though
Mi trattano come Robert De Niro
La ho portata Taco Bell, le ho comprato un churro
La ho portata a casa, le ho dato un cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeri su zeri su zeri (Zeri)
Quello è cosa il bilancio del mio conto bancario dice (Woo)
Ho a check dalla compagnia di scarpe
Ora faccio qualsiasi cosa che dice New Balance
Le ho comprato un biglietto aereo, fuori di stato
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Ho detto, ""Sono in città oggi""
Lei ha detto che she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' quella merda
Così quando she pull up on me so cosa she 'bout to say
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & DaBaby]
Come butta?
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
Ho delle opzioni
Potrei passare quella puttana come Stockton (It ain't nothin')

Chiama la mia puttana, dille, ""Prendimi that noggin"" (Brrt)
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Chiamami DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
Sono un vero creativo and stylish, F&N nel mio denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back da L.A. sul jet ieri (Nyoom)
I go back and forth come se giocassi a tennis
Fotto con la tua puttana, yeah, I'm fit for it
Ancora su Billboard, la canzone numero uno nel Regno Unito
And I done got so fuckin' rich, tutte queste puttane sul mio cazzo
Non mi frega ancora un cazzo di cosa mi dicono
Lei lo mangia come Pac-Man, negro (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga come se fossi Batman, negro (Eat it)
I just pulled up nella Batmobile (Nyoom)
La ragione per cui non fotto con questi rap-ass negri
Perché loro sono cap-ass negri (Cap)
E il loro rap non è vero (Cap)
Credimi, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, bisogno di un Squeegee
These niggas watered down, loro bevono Fiji
La mia auto è arancione e marrone come se fossi a Cleveland
La mia puttana è Mello Yello come una soda (Soda)

She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski

All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler in case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again

Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up

Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming

[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
""Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses""
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper
[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless

The time we spend apart will be a memory some day

Выучил о тройном кресте, когда был молодым и я знаю, что не пойду, так что я держу пушку
Я полетел в Париж просто, чтобы купить Dior
Она просит внимания, я не вижу её
C.I.P Pop, я хочу, чтобы ты мог увидеть нас

Look, uh, look

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah
[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky

Люблю тебя, когда ты распускаешь свои волосы без расчёски
И я остаюсь для себя, потому что я никогда не любил этих шлюх (Да)
И она любит только деньги, красный свет этим шлюхам
Почему я должен тратить своё время на шоути, у которой я не на переднем плане?
Особенно, когда ты получаешь дизайнерскую одежду и я пою вином и угощаю обедом
И Bentley пришёл с крыльями, как номер девять, да
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём

Получил эту большую Birkin сумку стоимостью пять, шесть чисел
Ты может был не в своей лиге, ты можешь купить это, нигга? (Купи это)
Я подхожу к её вершине ухожу на рассвете, я дон
Ты можешь валять дурака, если хочешь, если хочешь
На Бали, большие качели, большое платье
Большая жопа, заставляю её сквиртить и делать большую грязь
До того, как мы закончили, она спросила ""Где мы займёмся этим в следующий раз?""
Дальше, так мокро, что испортили сиденья в самолёте

Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here

It's bigger than black and white

Godzilla,Eminem Featuring Juice WRLD,2020,"Russian cover  - Godzilla (Eminem feat. Juice WRLD) LyricsОх, да ты просто монстр

[Куплет 1: Dicon]
Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла
Попаду в колоду, будто крупье в казино
Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана ""Мозга"" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...
[Припев: Dicon]
Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

[Куплет 2: Dicon]
Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну
Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу
Магический шар
В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

[Куплет 3: Dicon]
Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!
Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...

Чел стой
Смотри что в планах!

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""

[Refrain : Young Thug]
Ouais, m'cassant à l'ouest (S'casser), vendant à l'ouest (Ouais)
Couteau métallique en or, j'peux te planter à l'ouest (Ouais)
Je viens de mettre un chargeur sur un nouveau Kel-Tec (Sur un)
Je viens de mettre mon sperme dans sa chatte, maintenant elle est mouillée

[Post-refrain : Young Thug]
J'avais l'habitude d'aller au fond du bus (Ouais), maintenant j'saute dans un jet (Ouais)
J'avais l'habitude de dire à cette p'tite go : ""C'est nous"", puis de me lasser
Je l'appréciais bien avant, mais maintenant je l'aime
La façon dont elle boit mon crachat
Ta salope te trompe, elle est sous ma couverture, on fait des câlins et tout
[Couplet 1 : Young Thug]
Maintenant, ma belle dit qu'elle veut sucer le bout
C'est mon délire, bébé, je veux tes quatre lèvres (Mon délire)
Ex-camarade de classe, elle peut enfoncer un bateau
J'mange la molly et j'vais tripper cette salope
Ouais, ma belle, ouais, chérie, ouais, mon bébé, suce mes parties
Ferme les yeux, c'est juste toi et moi et personne
Ouais, suce-le sur le côté, qu'on soit en public ou sur la route (Hey)
Des sensations dans cette pute (Wouh), des sensations sur un jet (Wouh)
Cinq mille liasses, ouh
C'est une vraie bad girl, sa bouche envoie fort
Elle sait qu'elle a eu un déclic
Avec une chatte en bouche d'incendie (Hey)

Ouais, m'cassant à l'ouest (S'casser), vendant à l'ouest (Ouais)
Couteau métallique en or, j'peux te planter à l'ouest (Ouais)
Je viens de mettre un chargeur sur un nouveau Kel-Tec (Sur un)
Je viens de mettre mon sperme dans sa chatte, maintenant elle est mouillée

[Couplet 2 : Travis Scott]
C'est en haut, c'est coincé (Ouais)
T'as cru qu'tu pouvais t'faire le gang, à quoi tu pensais ? (Gang)
Coupé rouge, le bruit des montagnes russes
Ces jours-ci, j'équilibre toute la haine avec de l'amour
Ces jours-ci, je verse toute ma douleur dans un verre (Glou glou)
Rêveur, c'est qu'un effet secondaire quand tu es avec nous (Le jeu)
Du calme, les gars sont juste derrière moi, ils sont sur les nerfs
Crois-moi, on sort en ville pour amasser (Ouh)
Des sensations dans cette salope, ils sont surpris que je sois encore en vie (C'est lourd)
J'ai testé, j'peux pas m'faire tuer, testé neuf fois mais j'suis Stilts
J'monte dans la caisse pour être bien à fond
Aqua dans la caisse, t'as capté (Ouh)

She knows what the fuck is up, I don't gotta dumb it down
Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's Run The Town
I love her, she's a freak
I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East, ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace

Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?

Going for that arsenal dub
Somehow never got my builder's club
Newbie, i'm not an oder
Won't you ever understand
I only simp for builderman
Boy it's obvious that you're such a noob
Laggy internet that you barely move
And you love dying in murder mystery 2
Now i'm tired of you acting so confused
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob

We could stick to playing the blox as we grow up
If i could then i would give you all my robux
But i'm sorry i can only give you bobux
I'm talking anthro
Arsenal, winning every bloxy
Finding every key to escape from the piggy
Got a tycoon, now i'm spitting out money
Got a simulator full of bees making honey
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof

Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind

I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind

DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up

Fightin' birds in the damn sky 'cause I'm damn fly
Gold mine of a mind
Full kai, Super Saiyan on these niggas
Ayy, grind on my dick like a Ripstik, uh
My body count is like 60, uh
Your bitch on me, she need CPR

I sucked her toes, yes I'm freaky, yes
Caught a grand theft just like GTA
If he talk shit, watch me beat him, ayy
Hop on that beat and I beat the A
Work-work-work, shout out to RiRi, ayy
Keep a blade on me like Sasuke, uh
Shout out my nigga ImDontai, uh
Build to the pussy like Fortnite, uh

Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

I've been daydreaming when I'm on the percs
Niggas broke as a joke, they ain't puttin' in work
We all toting them poles, we'll take a few souls
Even my lil' bitch got a gun in her purse
It's been about three months, I was sippin' that syrup
Had me sleepwalkin', talking with a slur
If I catch him walking, leave him on the curb
Desert Eagle will shoot him, call it Larry Bird
Play with your bitch, yeah she insecure
She know that I'm Juice Man, 2Pac Shakur
She know that I know how to make pussy purr
Your nigga he ugly, he creepin', a nerd, ayy
Huh, I'm sure he probably be slippin' hoes roofies for sure
I don't need no molly for me to be savage
I don't need no molly to give you the world
Got a couple AP's, I don't fuck with no Pateks
But guess it's the best, so I got 'em, they dance
And I'm rich as a bitch, I don't know how to manage
Bank account like the zoo, goin' apes and bananas
Smokin' dope 'till I choke up and rollin' up Runtz
You want smoke then my niggas'll give you the cancer
Like a bad TV show in this ho, you'll get cancelled
I'm Michael Jackson, nigga, you Randy, uh
Do it so effortless, make it look easy
I gave my girl dick when she screamin' out, ""Feed me""
One in the head, F.N on preheat
Hit a bitch nigga face, ain't CB, RiRi
Diamonds on water, my VVS on Fiji
I'm magic even when I'm bored, Ouija
Niggas need me to make an all-star team
Take the score motherfucker, I know you need me
No limit nigga, on limitless pills
I been high for a minute, this shit gettin' critical
My baby told me that she'll kill for me
That turn me on, so I eat the pussy like cereal
I'm doin' shit that I wasn't a year ago
I go to London, come back, I'm like, ""Cheerio""
Hang with the criminals, you get to trippin'

Let her suck on my toes 'cause I'm nasty (Okay)

Now she tellin' me she legally blind
Gave her a towel and told her she fine
She kept suckin' 'til she started cryin' (Come here, come here)
Point 'em out, shoot 'em out, I spot 'em, I got 'em (Come here)
He started runnin', so I caught 'em (Ayy, ayy)
Bag on his head, I bought 'em (Ayy)
Told my shooter do everything that I taught him (Ayy)
Let me know if it's a problem
Like a school boy, I be super quick to solve it
Thinkin' my shooter retarded
He take a pill and then snort it right off of his .40
Snort it right off of his gun (No)
Shot a hunnid, then paid a hunnid for his bond (No, no)
Send a diss, I won't respond (No)
Slam dunk a nigga like a nigga was LeBron (Come here)
Leave a nigga where he stay
Same place that I met him, I made him lay (Come here, come here)
Let a nigga come and play
He gon' tell his momma, ""Plan the funeral date"" (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
I got the power like Nelson Mandela
You need a umbrella whenever I spray (Whenever I spray)
Leave him shitty like Nutella
He gon' need a Pamper if he survive this K ('Vive this, ayy)
Me and my niggas, we down for whatever
We step on whoever in retro J's (Retro J's)
Bullet, stick like a thorn, call it Bella
Make him Cinderella if he betray, bitch

[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 7: Pooh Shiesty]
I'm strapped up wit' this jug, one in the head, already de-cocked (It's de-cocked)
I pop out when the beef hot, won't see me creepin' on your block (Nope, nope)
I work the back seat, we went three deep and got ten people shot (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
I hit the auto-switch and made it twerk and while he dumped the Glock (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Got the drop on all his spot, he gettin' robbed if he go or not
I know the taste and love Wock', he pourin' up in exotic pop
That booster hitter tried to pull a move and that shit got him dropped
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd, you pussies know what's up
Turn a nigga to a pack, we break 'em down and roll 'em up
Ain't shit changed but the whip, now it's a Rolls truck when I'm pulling up
And I still ain't check the time up on my Cartier, just hold it up (Blrrrd)
Don't come around acting gangster, we call your bluff (Blrrrd-blrrrd)
Put trust in these firearms, know we dangerous
If you catch me speed up, bitch, give it up or I'ma buss
We shoot your shit up on the E-Way, get out the same lane as us
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd (Same lane as us), Big Blrrrd

[Chorus: SpotemGottem & Pooh Shiesty]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam (Blrrrd), knock your legs off (Legs off)
Tried to get away from me (Yeah), had a standoff (Blrrrd-blrrrd)
Hit 'em in his spine, knock his dreads off (Blrrrd)
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Th— Th— Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
OG made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 8: DDG]
Hit 'em in his spine one more time for that sweet talk
Gave my nigga some time, he was selling all that re-rock
Get him hit, he drop
""Hood Melody"", free Top
Tweet it all, post and delete
My bitch can not get over me
I be in that pussy geeked
I'm a nigga you should keep
Don't be asking who is me
Before I fuck you, Google me
Them comments don't be moving me
Fuck is they gon' do to me?
You do for me, I do for you (Yeah)
You cool with me, I'm cool with you
My momma said ""They using you, drop 'em and keep doing you""
I'm number one, they number two
My bank account gon' humble you
Took a Perc' and it ain't work, so I took two and felt like Durk
That pill make me wanna flirt
Fly a bad bitch out to Turks
Fuck her once and give her merch
Block a bitch, I bet she lurk
Hit and quit it, leave her hurt
Sometimes I feel like a jerk
She did me wrong, I did her worse
Fix it with a Louis purse
Throw the Lambo' in reverse
We skrt, uh yeah, we gon' throw the Lambo' in reverse
Throw that ass and make it twerk
We ran her, but I hit 'em first
All them bitches on The Shade Room wanna fuck me
Only if she lucky, I like sucky-sucky
They say she a ho, I don't know, but she love me
She came from Kentucky
I like how she fuck me
I like how these album sales got 'em talkin'
Bitch, I made a million off of ""Moonwalking in Calabasas""
Never bragging
I just hit this ghetto bitch, she hella ratchet
I just bought this Glock brand new it ain't got no attachments
Pew pew pew, pssht, boom boom, that bitch going off
I be in the club with hella chains on, I'm showing off
Bitch, I'm in my vibe and them comments tryna throw it off
Put a bitch on and she dipped that bitch throw the sauce

So much water on my neck, it's like I'm detoxin
Two drums and two sticks I'm beatboxin' (Grr, Hey)
I wish he would, We gon' treat top him (Pop, pop, pop)
I just blew 150 out the safe, I had to restock it (damn, damn)
Fuck a grammy I got the streets watching (streets watching)
And for my bro I wear that red until I'm dead
I know that he watching (R.i.p)
Left my ex bitch cause she toxic (Goddamn)
Got this new bitch now we toxic, Can't cap, I been toxic (Damn)
Told 'em pussy niggas keep watching (hm, hm)
Always got the .40 on me with the beam and plus I keep options (Grr, Pop)
Ready to get it started (Pop), Vv's on my chest
Now I'm cold hearted (uh), Diamonds go retarded (uh)
Living in big houses from apartments, Bitch I made it out
My money and my loyalty, Two things I’ll never play about (hm, hm)
My oppositions tryna take me out (Okay)
And I'm fucked up in the head and they gon' make me bring my brazy out
Fuck what you thought ain't shit to think about (No, no)
A Twenty pack could get him whacked, Turn my head up ""Fuck it, lay him out""
We gon' ball regardless, Twenty bottles in my section, Look like alcoholics (Ooouuu)
Free my blooder, Murder gang, I hope you beat them charges (Gang)
I be on that private plane, Champagne when we departed, OG I'm the God
So much body on this bitch can't even park it
I don't never rep my jewelry (Skrr), If I were bitch I bought it (Facs)
That's cause I could afford it (Facs)
I've been fucking up these rap beats so long, It's getting boring now
They like ""M.A how you been?"" can't even call it
I just handle business, Mind my business, Feet up in my office
Prolly counting racks out, My stacks look like math books
The money turn me on, It's just some' bout ""how that cash look""
Bad bitch she need her ass whopped (need her ass whopped)
She a pretty lil dicky, But ay lil mama ""how that bag look?""
You look good but if you're broke then, That's a bad look
Turn around, Let me get that last a look (Ooouuu)

Thuggin' in my Reeboks
Ten milli', big Glocks, huh
In a big truck, fuck around, make your ears pop
Fuck with me, gang'll do some' to you, make your tears drop
Hit 'em off, Wafi only boy, I don't Sears shop
Fuck around, might move to Michigan and get my peers hot
Trustworthy, uh, I think not, we'll wipe snot
Three lines, gon' make it look like wine in a clear pot
Ride around with the same weapon, ain't get deer shot
No rearviews in my life, leave that shit behind me
I was only eighteen years old when Kanye tried to sign me
Niggas gangsters online 'til you see 'em named Mahatma Gandhi
Better tell my bitch, ""Let's get a bitch that's tatted like Kehlani""
If she tell me yes, I'll let you know the when and where's to find me
Niggas already thinkin' that they wildin', steady tryna guide me
Finna blind me, standin' in my way, they need to get behind me
Every day I ride with a rocket just like my first name Johnny
White diamonds got more colors than a Murakami
Bitch thought I was Japanese, I folded just like origami
Used to sleep in front of Shoney's, now I got an eighty-inch Sony
Rich as hell, used to be broke, fucked up, eatin' bologna
Niggas not like us, we get to the money
How the fuck we wipe his nose and we still left it runnin'?
How you fly with nothin' to your name? Man, you niggas bummin'
'Member tryna get kids to game, they ain't listen to me

On Me,Lil Baby,2021,"On Me Lyrics[Intro]
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

[Verse 1]
Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong
[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

[Verse 2]
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec

Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)
[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

Ох (Я пытаюсь схватить их), ох (Я пытаюсь схватить их)
Ох, ох (Хватай их), ох
Ох (Получаю большой на этом), ох, ох, ох
Ох, ох, ох, ох
Ох, ох, ох
Чего ты хочешь?Не буду говорить тебе дважды, да
Я вор в ночи (Вор в ночи), ох
[Припев: Pop Smoke]
Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я очень осторожный, как вор в ночи (Смотри)

[Куплет 1: Pop Smoke]
Если я зову тебя деткой, то ты детка на день
Или детка на ночь, ты не моя жена
Она хочет убийцу, чтобы трахаться всю ночь
Я хочу трахаться с тати, соси мне всю ночь
AP, большие камни, на районе с гориллами
Пять K на обед, приношу триста тысяч дилеру

[Припев: Pop Smoke & Lil Baby]
Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
Сказал, я знаю, как стрелять (О-о) и я знаю, как драться
Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я очень осторожный, как вор в ночи (Бэйби)

[Куплет 2: Lil Baby]
Я богатый, но я катаюсь, у меня мало экзотики, я должен вылететь и получить немного
Ничего не видел, все эти деньги на мне, сотня пачек в сумке, это медовая булочка
Baby OG, я бегал по этим улицам, получил игру из Lashawn
Я сын своей мамы
Выучил о тройном кресте, когда был молодым и я знаю, что не пойду, так что я держу пушку
Я полетел в Париж просто, чтобы купить Dior
Она просит внимания, я не вижу её
C.I.P Pop, я хочу, чтобы ты мог увидеть нас
Я и Cash плюс кто бы то ни был, я иду снова
У получил ниггеров на улице, не побьёшь меня
Я получил индустрию, пытаешься быть мной
Я просто Рэй Чарльз, они не могут увидеть меня
Я в Rolls-Royce с RiRi

[Куплет 3: DaBaby & Pop Smoke]
Как вор в ночи (Вор)
Я подъехал, дал ей D на ночь (Ах-хах)
Пытаюсь потрахаться в V, это хорошо (Давай трахаться)
Мы не можем испачкать мои сиденья, потому что они белые (Это мои сиденья, смотри на мои сиденья)
Я живу, как в ""Thriller"", я выхожу только ночью
Она не трахается с ликёром, не любит быть выпившей
Она не пьёт Henny, только белое вино (Что она делает?)
Открыл пробку в новом Pinot Grigio (Да)
Подъехал на Porsche с причудливой шлюхой (Зум)
Паркую Porsche и подъезжаю на Lambo (Хмф)
Я выпрыгиваю, Майор Пейн, раскачиваю камуфляж (Да сэр)
Думаю она милая, заставляю её трахаться, дай её мужчине идти (Она милая)
Люблю стрелять, зажигать тебя, сука, я Рембо
Кубинская ссылка полна камней, это чокер (Ох)
Покойся с миром Pop, заставь меня скурить тебя

[Припев: Pop Smoke]

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby

Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah

DJ Khaled

[Verso 1: Lil Baby e Lil Durk]
Risquei um milhão da minha lista de objetivos três anos atrás
Adicionei dois zeros no um, eu tô em um modo diferente
Essa é a minha vida, faço o que eu quero, eu tô com putas diferentes
Você sabe qual é a jogada, eu peguei ela e mandei pra casa
Eu fiquei muito rico, nós colocamos e retiramos
Você sabe que o Trappy acabou de sair, eu não tenho que colocá-lo na linha
Somos aqueles que tem os números, que colocaram a cidade no mapa
Estamos no meio do verão, eu coloquei um moletom
Meu tempo de braveza não é nada bom
Eu tento não vestir a mesma coisa duas vezes
Eu saí de um jogo de dados, yeah
Meu irmãozinho não tá vivendo direito
Minha irmã e eles estão bem
Meu primo e eles ainda servindo à vida, yeah
Vi um ladrão roubando a religião
Eu vi um pregador ser pego por trair
Eu vou falir o banco por um do meu povo
Eu disse: ""Eu sou o único"", eles não acreditaram em mim
Eu mostro os fatos pra eles, agora todos precisam de mim
Eu vou ter grana enquanto estiver respirando
Eles tornam isso difícil, essa merda é muito fácil, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Refrão: Lil Baby]
Eu vou acabar com um hater em cada chance que tiver
Eu quero o maior relógio que eles têm, não me importo se essa merda vai machucar o meu pulso
Todas essas putas transam com todos nós, eu gostaria de mandar naquela vadia
Elas ficam excitadas quando pegam nas armas, nós temos um armário cheio de peças
Assim que eles dizem que não podemos ir, você sabe que vamos correr em volta daquela porra
Você pode sentir a minha falta com essa merda, você sabe que eu vivo na mistura (Dinheiro, carros e roupas e putas)

Yeah, ela acha que eu sou um rapper normal, eu não sou
Uma pessoa veio me dizer, nós fuzilamos o seu quarteirão
Me observe levar essa merda pro topo, yeah (Continue)
Coloquei roupas da Givenchy nos meus filhos
Ela deve pensar que um mais um é três
Eu não posso te apoiar pessoalmente
Ela não tem hipoteca, foi morar com a sobrinha
Esses manos estão mentindo, os carros são alugados
O mais novo tá no comando, eu falo pelas ruas
Eu tava cochilando, eles acordaram uma fera
Aprendi lutando, costumávamos ter água pro jantar, não tínhamos nada pra comer
Assim que eu te pegar, eles vão olhar melhor pra mim, tipo, ""Caramba, ele tava mexendo comigo"", yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Eu sou das trincheiras
Os manos são durões na internet, mas realmente estão lá pra chamar a atenção
As vadias ficam conversando como se fossem realmente ricas
Mas realmente ficam implorando pra aparecer nas minhas fotos
Eu vou dar pra ela 40, 50 mil em dinheiro pra abrir um negócio
Eu vou gastar essa merda no dentista
Eu prefiro transar com ela e pagar o aluguel dela por um ano só pra me livrar dos sentimentos dela
Eu tô na Lambo' SUV no meu bairro, ninguém vai me dizer nada
Indo pra Cali, eu pego a minha erva com certeza, ninguém vai me

O Baby deixou o bairro dele muito bem, yeah, você pode dizer que eles são realmente ricos
Larguei a carga, não tem espaço agora, eu levei ela pro O
Então eu cheguei na Lamb' porque ela é fã do Boonie Moe
Eu tô fechado com a cidade, uh, acabando com toda a oposição

Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Post me a pic, finna make me a profit
When the liquor hit, then a bitch get toxic
(Why the fuck you in the club when niggas wildin’?)
I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)

Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit

No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I’m orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?

Pra ficar à frente dessa porra (Gangue), bebi lean como se fosse licor
A vida nas ruas vai fazer com que você alcance Deus mais rápido (Yeah, gangue)
Adesivo, AK-40 direto no seu fígado
Deixo o fuzil atingir você igual um Blood ou um Cripper (Gangue)
Flipper, tantos tiros, eu sou um ginasta
Ganhei tanto dinheiro com esses otários, com esses otários (Yeah, gangue)

[Verso 1: 21 Savage]
Eu sou o senhor derrubador dе corpos, a Gangue do Massacre é a sequеstradora de almas
Não é uma F-150 normal, isso é uma Raptor, porra
Sem mentira, sou um mano da rua, não um rapper
O fuzil atingiu ele e ele virou uma putinha
Smith & Wesson, eu tô representando a Gangue 4L

Me siento joven pero me tratan como el OG
Y quieren el chisme en mí, te juro que estas perras son entrometidas
Dijo que puso algo de dinero en mi cabeza, supongo que vamos a ver
No pondré dinero en su cabeza, mis negros me deben
Debo еstar soltero por un tiempo, no puedеs controlarme
Uno, dos, tres, en una carrera, no pueden retenerme
Y muestro mi cara en un caso para que sepas que soy yo
La imitación no es un halago, solo me molesta
Y también me preocupo por eso
Y la tierra que le tiraron a mi nombre
Se convirtió en abono y crecí fuera de ella
Hora de que todos averigüen qué van a hacer al respecto
Las ruedas grandes siguen rodando, rodando
[Coro: Drake]
Estoy afuera, veintinueve, G5, junto al mar
He estado perdiendo amigos y encontrando la paz
Pero, honestamente, eso me suena como un trato justo para mí
Si alguna vez escuché uno y todavía estoy aquí
Afuera, primera línea, Lado sur
He estado perdiendo amigos y encontrando la paz
Honestamente, eso me suena como un trato justo para mí

Mira, no me invites si haces otra fiesta de lástima
Mirando hacia atrás, es difícil decirte por dónde empecé
No sé quién me ama, pero sé que no es todo el mundo
Nunca podré amarla, ella tiene un cuerpo ocupado
Bebé, si me quieres, no puedes aparecer con todo el mundo, nah
No puedes estar follando con cualquiera, sí
Tengo sentimientos por ti, eso es lo que pasa, sí
Sabes que es algo cuando canto sobre eso, sí
Mamá solía tener una discapacidad, pero me dio esta habilidad
Y ahora ella camina con la cabeza en alto y la espalda recta
No creo que me sientas, estoy aquí
Siendo todo lo que dijeron que no sería y no podría ser
No sé qué les pasó a los chicos que dijeron que lo serían
Les dije los veo en la cima y me malinterpretaron
No guardo resentimiento en mi corazón, esa es la madurez

I'll be thuggin' 'til the end of time
And fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name
Make sure you write the truest in the motherfucking game
On my
[Chorus]
Tombstone when they bury me
By the river, they will carry me
Finally, I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally
I'll get to fly away, somewhere, someday
Fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name (Yeah)
Make sure you write the truest in the game
On my tombstone when they bury me (Yeah)
By the river, they will carry me (Yeah)
Finally, I'll be resting in peace (Oh yeah)
Finally, finally, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(You know what I’m saying, I don’t really know what I’m saying, I don’t know what’s after this shit)
Finally, finally (Everybody think they know but fuck it, I sleep on the floor)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (This shit comes with a lot, it’s a lot of pressure, I’m a young nigga though)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
On my tombstone when they bury me (Believe that man, I’m a hustler)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, on my tombstone when they bury me, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, finally I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally, on my tombstone when they bury me
By the river, they will carry me, I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally, yeahYou might also like37Embed"

Tyler Herro,Jack Harlow,2021,"TranslationsTürkçeРусскийTyler Herro Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)
[Verse]
Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)

See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much

Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals

I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosе guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are high still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still

The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money

CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be

The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure

Você reza pelos meus demônios, garota, eu entendo você
Toda vez que eu bebo codeína, fico vulnerável
Eu conheço os sons da tempestade quando ela chеga
Ela entende quе eu não posso levar ela pra todos os lugares que eu vou
Eu estive no campo tipo os filhos do milho
[Refrão: Future & Tems]
Eu posso ouvir suas lágrimas quando elas caem pelo telefone
Fica brava consigo mesma porque não consegue me deixar em paz
Fofoca, arrumando bagunça, isso não é o que estamos fazendo (O mundo estava acabando)
Viajar ao redor do mundo (Você choraria ou tentaria me pegar?)
Pelo telefone, derramando lágrimas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Eu fico mais vulnerável quando tomo pílulas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Quando você tá bêbada, você me diz exatamente como se sente (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Quando eu tô carregado, mantenho a real (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)
Por favor, fala pra um verdadeiro exatamente o que é (Eu vou esperar, vou esperar, por você, por você)
Não diga isso porque você sabe que é isso que eu quero ouvir (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)

[Verso 2: Drake & Tems]
Yeah, eu estive viajando ao redor do mundo
Eu sento na minha varanda e me pergunto como você tá se sentindo
Eu tenho uma carreira que tira meu tempo das mulheres
Eu não posso te convencer de que eu te amo pra sempre (Vou esperar por você, por você)
Eu vou estar te ligando, os sentimentos estão fluindo como um rio
Você vai estar mandando mensagens de volta pra Kiki no rio (Eu vou esperar por você)
A mensagem foi entregue (Eu vou esperar por você), mas eu sei que você não leu
Por que você nos apresenta se você sabia que tava com ele? (Eu vou esperar por você, por você, por você)
Me fez apertar a mão dele quando vocês estavam transando à um minuto (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Me fez caminhar na prancha, porque você sabe que eu sou um nadador (Eu vou esperar por você)
Eu deveria ser seu cachorro, mas você me colocou num canil
Garota, coloque uma focinheira nisso, em todos aqueles latidos durante o jantar
Eu tava fechado com você quando você ganhou o Presidencial pequeno
Você melhorou quando me conheceu e isso não é coincidência
Tentei trazer o melhor de você, acho que eu não sou tão influente
Acho que eu não sou o cara para você

Вновь проснулся бодреньким, так что знай: я в деле
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, шлюха, знай: я в деле
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, так что знай: я в деле

Йеа, жизнь
Жизнь — единственное, в чём мы нуждаемся
Им же нужно избавиться от меня, но я не хочу уходить
Покойся с миром, Лил Кид
[Куплет 1: Drake & J. Cole]
Нахуй голубятню, я — сова, совершенно другой уровень
Мог бы заставить её набить шестёрку на мизинце
Слышал, ты фанатеешь по баскетболу, просто дай мне знать
Будешь сидеть на играх в первом ряду, а не в далеке
Всё впоряде, детка, по крайней мере, сейчас
Не хочу стрессовать из-за суки, ведь скромности у меня не отнять
Ещё я готовлю амбиции прямо на кухонной плите
Травка уже кипит, смотри на пенку, хорошо пойдёт
Шлюхи говорят я обходителен, поэтому не попаду в лапы RICO
Бро считает себя Джоном Уэйном, купил ему жёлтых камней
Мне нравятся их тусовочки, детка, на хуй силикон
Все люди сейчас фейковые, ты могла бы разгадать мой шифр
Всё покрою брюликами и розовым золотом
Говорю с вами на языке дредов, словно Джей Коул
Могу сказать её минет хорош перед тем, как это узнать
Сучка, не строй из себя модель, если не была на обложке Vogue
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Они не пишут рэп, но могли бы выдать пару строк
Покойся с миром, Драма Кинг, мы с тобой умели показать стиль
Не нравится, как я говорю? Ниггер, скажи сам что-то
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Подьезжаем и ты узнаешь нас, басс бомбит нехило
Не нравится, как я говорю? Скажи сам что-то

Задаёшь много вопросов, сука, не строй с себя Надеску

Я со своей пушкой, как Розей с лимонным перцем
Ей хочется услышать афробит, ведь она закинулась Теслой

Но это не UFC, мой ствол шьёт, будто с компрессора (21)

Если хочешь вести здесь свои дела, то придётся брать ствол (21, 21)
А то бегаешь вокруг в страхе, подбери своё дерьмо (21)
Влюбился так, что голова идёт кругом, вот как я кручусь на районе (21)
Безумно люблю своего Boy'я, мой брат-близнец (21)
Если ниггеры продолжат диссить, то налетим опять на них (21)
Мы — причина, почему у оппов нет друзей (21)
Последний, кто хотел поиграть со мной, стал призраком
Я не зароллил его в Woods, ведь он заплесневел уже
Ты спрашиваешь, как её дела, я только что сказал прийти ей и заняться сексом
Выстрелил в него двадцать раз, блять, ниггер везунчик (Блять, ниггер везунчик)

Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta

Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh

C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco

Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at

Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back

Eu tenho que alimentar as ruas, minha pistola vai fazer sangrar pelas ruas
Balaclava na minha cara, às vezes você tem que trapacear
Pra ficar à frente dessa porra (Gangue), bebi lean como se fosse licor
A vida nas ruas vai fazer com que você alcance Deus mais rápido (Yeah, gangue)
Adesivo, AK-40 direto no seu fígado
Deixo o fuzil atingir você igual um Blood ou um Cripper (Gangue)
Flipper, tantos tiros, eu sou um ginasta
Ganhei tanto dinheiro com esses otários, com esses otários (Yeah, gangue)

[Verso 1: 21 Savage]
Eu sou o senhor derrubador dе corpos, a Gangue do Massacre é a sequеstradora de almas
Não é uma F-150 normal, isso é uma Raptor, porra
Sem mentira, sou um mano da rua, não um rapper
O fuzil atingiu ele e ele virou uma putinha
Smith & Wesson, eu tô representando a Gangue 4L
A gente batizou mais manos do que o reverendo (Yeah)
Kappa Alpha, eu e a minha gangue, fazemos todas as etapas
Quem você tá verificando? O tiro dessa FN vai do Oriente até o West End (Gangue)
[Verso 2: Drake]
Yeah
Ouvi dizer que o Papi tá lá fora
E ele tá com o duplo-R conversível lá fora
Verifiquei o tempo e tá ficando realmente estranho lá fora
Eu vou lançar essa merda e fazer esses idiotas descerem igual um maldito—
Tipo de cara que não consegue me olhar nos olhos
Eu desprezo
Quando eu te vejo, é melhor deixar esse maldito orgulho de lado
Muitas vezes, muitas vezes, eu sobrevivi
A treta tá acontecendo, alerta de spoiler, esse cara morre

[Verso 3: 21 Savage]
Ando armado e você sabe que a maconha é pegajosa
Meu dedo coça, a Glock gosta de deixar buracos
Seus atiradores são duvidosos, um punk da rua nunca poderia me desrespeitar
Eu venho direto do 6 e não poupamos os sessenta

[Verso 4: Drake]
Eu transei com ela, com ela também e ela
Eu quis errar e digo pra ela errar, com certeza
Maldito vodu, peguei ele enquanto eu voei com os turcos
Sei que os manos tiveram que atingi-los onde sabíamos que dói

[Refrão: 21 Savage e Drake]
Coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido (Yeah)
Coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido
Mano, coisa de gangue, é nisso que eu tô envolvido

Eu tô em toda parte
O Jacob me cobrou 450 mil por uma corrente pequena

Fala pro treinador não me tirar, eu gosto de assistir os jogos até o final
E a minha lírica é insana e os meus parceiros são insanos
Existem cerca de 80 de nós agora, essa é a coisa mais assustadora
O que eles estão fazendo naquele outro lado é constrangedor
Estamos em Paris com isso, cem quilates com isso
Toda essa merda é pro meu filho, porque ele vai herdar

2 AM at a Broadway bar
ساعت 2 بامداد تو یه بار تو خیابون برادوی
She's puttin' her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
شماره اش رو میزنه تو گوشیم (دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don't mean
دوتا بطری آبجو بادلایت تا آخر خورده شده،  و چیزایی میگه که منظوری نداره
And you know
و میدونی که

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
تو رستوان بار ""اَلدنز نشویل"" دیدمش
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
گفت که حدود یک مایل دورتر من رو در حال قدم زدن دید
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
پسر خاله ام ""بین"" فقط میخواست تلفنش رو ازش بگیره (تا ازم فیلم نگیره) و همین لبخندش رو از بین بر
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
گفت زیادی مست و دیوونه ام، نحوه رقصیدنم رو دوست نداره
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
گفتم: مجبور نیستی بهم ملحق بشی. گفت شانسشو امتحان میکنه
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
از وقتی که نقشه ام شکست خورد یه جورایی دیوونه بودم
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
یه جورایی گم شدم، و این چیزی بود که فهمیدم
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
دخترای مثل تو فقط میخوان من رو دور بزنن، دور بزنن، دور بزنن
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, there's two things that you'rе gonna find out
اوه، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only lovе you right now
اونا عاشقت نیستن و فقط همین الان دوستت دارن
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
اگه زرنگ بودم، میموندم خونه
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)

Leave them Broadway girls alone

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
اهالی شهرشون بهم گفتن: بهشون (به دخترای برادوی) اعتماد نکن
Broadway girls a trap
دختر اهل برادوی یه تله است
They on me, they tryna finesse me
مهمون منن، سعی میکنن زرنگی کنن
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
منو با ""مرگان"" دیدن و میدونن رپ میکنم
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
اسب من (ماشینم) پورشه، بهم توجه میکنن
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
پریدم رو یه اسب، اونم نشست پشتم
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
رفتم بار تا واسش یه نوشیدنی بگیرم
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
بهم گفت رپ دوست نداره، آهنگ های ""پینک"" رو گوش میده
I can't run out of money
نمیتونم بی پول بشم (معنی دوم: نمیتونم بدون پول ادامه بدم)
The trenches love me forever
محله های فقیرو خلافکار همیشه دوستم دارن
They treat me like Ed in London
مثل ""اد شیرن"" تو لندن باهام رفتار میکنن
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
بردمش استخر، بعدش رایگان یه آبجو گرفتم
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
بوت های ""تیکوواس""، گیتار، سیگار، بار مشروب
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
مثل ماشین ها سوار گاو نر میشه، معمولا با آدم معروفا خوب نیس

Banger
Oh yeah, I'm finna make a banger with this one

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Last time you told me you proud of me, you wasn't proud of me, you was the nigga who doubted me
I was too mad at you, you let 'em come kill you, my brother, that shit was a tragedy
But magically, I got the strategy, I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me
""Who was the killers between the hood?"" (DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
Bro, I'm a king, that mean we good
Talked to my tete about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my chopper
Before I was twelve, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?
Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Stopped taking drugs, had to sit in a sauna
How you gon' blame me? I gave her Gabbana
Bitch, I'm a star, gotta use condom
Don't drink Par, only like Wocka
Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my pocket, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, high speed, no tossin'
Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch, my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you
Get out my business, that shit don't concern you
I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you
I love the trenches, this shit is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (Oh no, oh)
Gave my bro twenty, he caught for a burglary
I love the bitches who say they ain't heard of me

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and got some more problems
We from the sandbox, my dawg since a toddler
Sixteen years old when I shot my first chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa-locka
Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters (Fly helicopters)
I count every blessin', they count every dollar
I'm 'bout to go factory plain
I treat all of my dawgs the same
Take care all of my bitches the same
I just hope you financially sane
Never turning my back on the gang
From the A, we was taught to be brave
Had to squabble and take a few fades
Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase
Damn my nigga, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered
I got style, I don't know what you heard of
You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile
Only real ones throughout my circle

Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada
Bro get this money like it's my religion
It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas
That try to compare whatever I did
Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig
I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid
I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib
I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's
Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in
I give you my fully, no matter where I'm in
Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean
You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win

Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Nigga, wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Nigga, wer will mit mir rauchen?
[Part 1: Nardo Wick]
Wer will mit mir rauchen? Ich versuche, die Lunge eines Niggas zu zerstören
Sie sind wie, „Nardo, nimm die verdammten Waffen hoch“
Scheiß drauf, sag': „Großer Bruder, hol die Waffen raus“
Wenn es raucht, können wir Runden drehen, während die Sonne scheint
Mir fehlt es nie an etwas, ich tanke mit gezogener Pistole
Schrei raus, „Was ist passiert?“ Dann mach dich an die Arbeit, bis sie zu Ende ist
All diese Niggas verstecken sich, und ich bin so, wo sind sie? Es macht keinen Spaß mehr
7.62s groß wie die Hölle, werden einem Nigga die Lunge aus dem Körper sprengen
Eins, zwei, drei, vier (Tret’ die Tür ein, leg dich auf den Boden)
Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht (Mach keinen Lärm, sonst fresse ich dein Gesicht)
Neuen, zehn, elf, wir sagen die Nummer nicht, wir hängen nicht mit Jakes
Ich werde vierzehn Niggas töten, wenn dreizehn Schlampen-Niggas spielen
Ich glaube, mein Draco könnte schwul sein (Wieso?), denn er bläst Niggas
Ich habe gerade einen brandneuen Lolli bekommen, das ist ein Four-Nickel
Nennt mich Nardo Ja-Mann, ich kenne nicht einen Nigga
Du kannst deinen besten Mann schicken, du wirst deinen besten Hitter verlieren

Draußen mit euch allen großen Homies, seid dabei, ich behalte die Leute bei mir (Bop)
Ich habe es wieder im Blut, ihr wisst es nur nicht, so sollte es sein (Psch)
Rief ihn für ein Feature an, nur um ihn zu töten, weil wir wissen, dass er süß ist (Grrah, grrah)
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, wer zum Fick ist das?
Bruder, sieh an der Tür nach, schau aus dem Fenster und vergiss die Strap nicht (Los geht's)
Ich bin am Arsch, wenn ich Opps sehe, vergesse ich, dass ich rappe (Ja, tue ich)
Ich bin immer dabei, egal, wo ich bin, das habe ich von der 'Raq gelernt
Er wird alles trinken, was ihm ein Nigga verkauft, nur um zu sagen, dass er high ist
Wenn ein Nigga stirbt, sagen sie: „Er war nicht mal bei dem Scheiß dabei“ (Er ging)
Die Notaufnahme wird euch immer anlügen, wenn ein Nigga stirbt (Wahr)
Sagen, dass ein Nigga stabil ist, nur um euch ruhig zu halten (Los geht’s)
Bronem stampft ihn
Tu besser, was Nardo sagt, denn Nigga sterben beim Tanken (Boom)
Warum tust du so, als wäre das etwas Exklusives? Schlampe, das ist ein öffentlicher Arsch (Öffentlicher Arsch)
Kann kein Nigga, mit dem wir nicht ficken, vorbeikommen, stampfen wir ihn
Nardo spricht, schleich dich aus dem Schnitt, wir mögen pscht, pscht
Nardo spricht, fang ihn, bevor er wegläuft, die Pistole macht pscht, pscht (Grrah)
Ey, wen hast du getötet? Du redest ständig, als wäre es eine Übung (Gang)

E eu estive esperando tanto tempo
Agora eu tenho que ressurgir (Eu tenho que ressurgir)
E sim, estamos prestes a brindar
Toda aquela grana que queimamos (Queimamos, queimamos, queimamos)
Porque eu tenho me sentido preso (Yeah)
Eu tenho estado fodidamente preso (Preso, mm-mm-mm)

Até a luz do dia chegar, até a luz do dia chegar
Eu tenho Saké na minha barriga, cigarro nos meus pulmões
São onze da manhã e ainda não terminamos
E eu ainda sou aquela vadia, e daí?

Me provocam o tempo todo
Querem que eu minta, querem que eu chore, querem que eu morra (Vida real)
Ah, ah, ah, eu continuo vivo, continuo vivo, continuo vivo, continuo vivo
Mais uma, yeah
Me provocam o tempo todo
Querem que eu minta, querem que eu chore, querem que eu morra (DJ Khaled)
Ah, ah, ah, eu continuo vivo, continuo vivo, continuo vivo, continuo vivo

[Verso 1: Drake]
Como ela tá apaixonada e já se apaixonou antes?
Não é como se eu conhecеsse ela há mesеs
Essa vida me permitiu pegar pelo o que eu quero
Não é como se eu soubesse o que quero
Não é como se eu soubesse o que preciso
Eu tenho um pouco de tempo, mas não existe garantias
Quando eu tava falido, ela tava sendo uma provocação
Quatro bolsos cheios, agora ela tá de joelhos
Woah, woah, woah-woah
O Baby vai comer, depois vai mandar ela pra mim, yeah
Ou eu vou comer e mandar ela pro Baby
É assim que eu fico quando essa vida fica muito louca
Woah, woah, de verdade, de verdade, woah
Eles tentam selar o acordo
Me encontre debaixo dos lençóis, desfilando nas ruas, yeah

Querem que eu minta, querem que eu chore, querem que eu morra (Oh, yeah)
Ah, ah, ah, eu continuo vivo, continuo vivo, continuo vivo, continuo vivo

[Verso 2: Lil Baby]
Eu coloco meus sentimentos de lado, você quer que eu morra, mas, baby, eu continuo vivo
Deveria ser a única, você tá andando quilômetros, eu pensei que você tava pronta pro desafio
Eu tô tentando aumentar o estilo dela, vamos na Chanel, ela pega tudo no tamanho dela
Ela tá envolvida com outro cara, eu nem me importo, sempre que vejo ela, ela é minha
O Drizzy comeu nela, depois mandou ela pra mim
Eu não falo, definição de P
Sou um cara da quebrada que virou superstar, mas eu transo gostoso com ela como se ainda estivéssemos nas ruas
Sem resposta, você pode ver que eu li
Eu tô com tudo isso sempre que você estiver pronta
É claro que vão ficar feliz se eu cair, mas eu ainda tô lá, eles vão ter que aceitar

Ayy

[Verse 1: SleazyWorld Go]
Last opp we caught was at the store, we had to scrape him (Skrrt)
Lil' bro hopped out trippin' with that switchy, he done faced him (Grrt)
Face shot, face shot, frrt frrt, they couldn't save him
We the ones gettin' busy up in the city, that's on my baby (That's on my son)
They block like a drive-thru, ask the opps how much we slide through
Ain't beefin', but you they family, you get caught, then you gon' die too (Dumbass)
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, stop the whip
Let me out, this chopstick gon' leave him open like a zip (Zzz)
Zip him up, tell buddy 'nеm ass to come and pick him up (Come pick him up)
Niggas fakin', acting like thеy thug life 'til we hit 'em up (Hit 'em up)
Lot of niggas don't like me, for what? I ain't even did shit (I ain't even did nothin')
Make his bitch take dick to the head, I ain't even hit yet
How you mad she choosing me? I like what she do to me
She say she feel safer over here, this where the shooters be
She say ain't no pape' up over there, shit, she barely eatin' (She starvin')
Can barely feed hisself, she told me, ""Help, this nigga barely feed me""
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
How you mad she choosin' me?
You would die if you know what she was doin' to me (Ooh)
We been swappin' spit for a lil' while, this shit ain't new to me
Actin' like I'm chasin' her or somethin', she be pursuin' me
Can't hold you, she be tellin' me all the time she wish that you was me (She bold)
I ain't with that messy shit, I barely'll text a bitch (I'm cold)
I can't even brag about these thots, that shit be effortless (Damn)
Red and white Ferrari, I come through fresh as a peppermint
Ain't caught up in that other shit, they trippin', I'm Black excellence (Yeah)
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold the jet
Seven-fifty for a show, I gotta go, can't miss this check
Travel all around the globe, doin' what I want with no regrets
She feel safe with us, whenever she with gang, it make her wet, yeah

[Verse 3: SleazyWorld Go]
We don't do the social tweet, these niggas too internet
Goin' live, tryna talk 'bout who got shot, we don't get into that
Can you leave it up in the streets with me? I ain't tryna go to jail (I ain't tryna go to jail)
Keep mention my name in all of your posts, it ain't hard to tell (What the fuck?)
If you get smoked, they gon' come lookin' for me, nigga, you dumb as hell
This bitch think I love her, ooh-wee, she must be drunk as hell
I can't love no slut bitch, I love how they suck dick (I like how they eat dick)

Get a hotel for a year straight, ain't no pillow where I stay
I know bitches who set niggas up, yeah
I know niggas who whack bitches too, yeah
I been in a hundred million movies
Life is real, let her pop a pill, she enjoyed herself
Bad bitches, put 'em in the ring, they go below the belt
No referee, ain't no stoppin’ me, I’m tryna take it there
The only problems I'm havin’ in life is which watch I'ma wear
I grew up on that take it shit, I don't know how to steal
I ain't with all that fakin’ shit, I'd rather keep it real
You mad at me about a bitch who fucking both of us
I went and ran my money up, I swear it's over for 'em
I done gave my feelings up, I don't know who to trust
Shit comin' up missin' at the spot, I don't know who to bust
She my gangster bitch, I gave her racks and told her, ""Stash that""
Love it when you throw it back like, damn, you know that ass fat
You know I'ma blast back, you know I'm way past that
So why you acting like it's something that it wasn't?
She know how to make me mad, I swear this bitch push every button

Bae, don't put me on your camera, you know what I look like
She like, ""Put it in me raw,"" I asked her like, ""What I look like?""
Bae, just call me when you get here, you know I don't book flights
We can't pop out, it won't even look right
I just hit the woman of my dreams with another bitch
I done scratched ten million off my bucket list
I'm never on no sucker shit

Buildin' up for my kids' kids' kids, I ain't gon' never quit
Investin' my money in all type of shit, ownership
Please don't involve me in all that messy shit, I don't want the bitch
I put twenty-sixes on my Cullinan, that country shit
Buildin' up my audience, I'm all in other countries with it
Maxin' out my debit cards in one store
Take a pretty girl and give her what she want, I'm just having fun

Young nigga way outta state
Fucked up, gettin' over pain
Look how far a nigga came
You remember I ain't had a thing
Fucked up, walkin' through the rain
At the top of the game, should've seen the niggas I was tryna bring
It's crazy the way these niggas change
Tell the city girl chill, you know baby mama know the deal
She know I could beat that pussy
Okay, let's switch the subject
Notice that both of my wrists is flooded
I been grindin' so hard, gеttin' to this money
I been working like I know the drought is coming
Monday to Monday, Sunday to Sunday, you know I'm street running
Okay, my daddy was a gangstеr, what the fuck that made me?
Niggas claiming that it's love dawg but it can't be
Know I fell in love with guns by the age of thirteen
And my pocket rocket on me, homie don't reach
Fuck dying in my Cuban link, I'm living in my Richard Millie
I just finished my tour, what a wonderful feeling
I got inside my bag and got out my feelings
I'm out my feelings
[Chorus]
Hey there everybody, what's it like in your city?
I'm a thousand miles away but look, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do, oh
Times Square couldn't shine as bright as you
I swear, it's true
Look, look
Hey there everybody, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right here if you get lonely
Give this song another listen, close your eyes
Uh, listen to my voice, it's my disguise

Hey, oh, yo
Why oh, why oh, why oh, why you keep fuckin' with me?
You gon' make me jump out my skin, believe me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""
Push these bitches off me like, ""Huh""

Pushin' the snakes, I'm pushin' the fakes
I'm pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh"" (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Aha, I be immune to shit (Aha)
Tucking the broom and shit (Aha)
They want to assume and shit (Aha)
Know you a choke, my ancestor close
I howl at the moon and shit (Aha)
Know the rеsults, the ballot is in, man, I'm 'bout to boom again (Aha)
You funny, dawg
Peek-a-boo, can't hide behind your monеy, dawg
A week or two, I meditate on runnin' lost
Swerve, swerve, swerve, shake the currents off, yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""

Pick my daughter up, she need all the love
I need all the love, I mean all of us
It's like six o'clock, bitch, you talk too much
You makin' it awkward, love
I mean, it's hard enough, I mean, it's—

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
They don't fuck with me even if they could
Pull out the stick, hit a bitch with the wood
First to park Rolls Royce, 'vert in the hood
Don't worry about us, over here we good
The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals
I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin' shit out in the cubicle
Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that bitch look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can't ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a nigga fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds
Yeah, you niggas can't stand the rain, you niggas don't stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz
I caught a bale off a Google app
I'm the type to get my shooter whacked
I had to survive off a tuna pack
Five percent tint on the whip like, ""Who was that?""
Coupe take off like it's mad
Beat the dope with a fork, I'm whippin' up Sudafed, I'm doin' scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday's son's day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain't have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles
Audemars water, aqua, beatin' the block up 'til we spot 'em
I don't want your ice, boy, I want your life, but fuck it, I still might rob 'em
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""
Push these bitches off me like, ""Huh""
Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' the snakes, I'm pushin' the fakes
I'm pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh"" (Yeah)

Me Or Sum,"Nardo Wick, Lil Baby & Future",2022,"Me or Sum Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro: Future]
Drop your location, she think she me or some' (Hendrix)
Put on my chains, now she think she me or some'
She keep a Glock in her bag, she think she me or some' (Pluto)
VVS rocks with the cash, she think she me or some' (Keep it Z3N)

[Verse 1: Future]
Came out hustlin' with the bag, oh no
I can't get it to the gossip
Bitch can't see me in binoculars
Run up the check up in Prada
You runnin' 'em racks up, I'm proud of you
All bad bitch eat seafood
Took the hot box on a detour
Came back, red on the bottom of my shoe
Posted with devils, she thinkin' she me or some'
Canary yellow, she thinkin' she me or some'
Step like a stepper, she drippin' Emilio Pucci
She think she me or some'
She barely ever poppin' outside
But when she do (When she do), tryna kill some'
My number one hitter, always movin' in silence
She the truth, real one
You can ask her if she gang, gang
She gon' tell you she rep the same thing I do (Yeah)
She not my main thing
But on the weekends, she lovin' my crew, lovin' my crew
[Part II]

[Verse 2: Nardo Wick]
She said she got a man, I act deaf, I don't hear her
Come here, girl, stop playin', let me put it in your liver (Put it in your liver)
Eat what's in my pants, bae, don't gotta go to dinner
I stole her heart, thou shall not steal, like I'm sorry, I'm a sinner
Let her put my chains on, now she think she me or somethin'
Got a special ringtone, when it beep, I know she comin'
She just put her hair on, now she think she flee or somethin'
Nardo hit that G spot, when she scream, I know she cummin'
I put her in LV, on my feet is LV
I think I'm a lover boy, sing to your bitch like Elvis
My bitch in the front seat, my other bitch in back seat
Nardo, who your other bitch? I'm talkin' 'bout my choppy
Know I keep a bankroll, ""Baby, count my bankroll""
Put it in your purse, she say, ""It's too much, bae, it won't go
Too much, bae, it won't fold, too much, bae, I'm gon' choke""
I know I got a lot of y'all, but, baby, you my favorite ho

[Bridge: Nardo Wick]
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not

Baby in this bitch like, ""Let me through here""
I need millions for the new year
Send a threat, I send my crew there
Know they hate how big I blew up
Got that check for real, went Audemars Piguet and bought my boo one
Think my favorite car's my blue one, pop that shit for real, I do this
Put my heart inside my safe deposit box 'cause I ain't gon' use it
I made forty million last year, and that's just off my music
I done finally got the mothafuckin' ball, and I ain't gon' lose it
Seem like everybody snoozin' while I'm steadily improvin'
I get money like I'm Jewish, I'm gon' be the one
She got all them bracelets up her arm, look like she me or somethin'
She get new Chanel whenever she want to like it's free or somethin'
I been buyin' Birkin bags for bitches like they three for one
Excuse my French, I'm sorry, mommas, this Phantom cost five hunnid
I been lit for five summers, everyone know how I'm comin'
Real exotic bags for thirty-five, we got our side pumpin'
Niggas don't want war with us, I'll spin until my last hunnid, yeah

[Verse 4: Future]
Rackies on rackies, now she think she me or some'
Dressin' like she tecky, now she think she me or some'
Count up cash really fast, now she think she me or some'
Keep the extendo in her bag, now she think she me or some'
Walked in with a baddie, now she think she me or some'
Gon' drop the addy, now she think she me or some'
Bust down an Audemars, now she think she me or some'
Cop another foreign car, now she think she me or some'
Bitch don't need a stylist, she must think she me or some'
Always goin' viral, she must think she me or some'
Turn up on a bad ho, she must think she me or some'
Diamonds on her rings and her chain, think she me or some'
Posted up, runnin' with her gang, think she me or some'
Flawless, Freeband gang, reppin' like she me or some'

Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm

[Verse 1]
My nail tech knows how to keep a lil' secret
I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweakin'
I look like I been gettin' money, I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walkin' 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix and I'm handshakin' but most of y'all can't help me (Nah)
Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope), most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and this shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it, like ""What's up?"" (What's up?)
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up (Can't fuck up)
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up (Stuck up)
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out and I chuck 'em up
First listen, they hearin' this shit like, ""What the fuck?""

And I'm not no fashionista, but I'm fly though (But I'm fly)
And I know I gave up drinkin', but I'm high though (But I'm high)
I told her, ""I don't cum from head, but you can try though"" (You can try)
I'm not on top of this shit yet, but I'm that guy though
I take a look 'round and my comp and it's just, uh (Ooh)
Wide open, big whippin', it slide open (Mm-mm)
I notice they treat me like I'm chosen (I'm chosen)
Eyes open, heart clean and my mind focused

How the hell could you doubt us?
I mean, back then it made sense, but it's like, now what?

One night, she cook for me, next day I'm blocked on Instagram (Damn, woah)
Let me find out that she did me like I do these hoes (Karma)

Some months go past, I ain't talk to her, ain't seen her (What's up?)
Asked her how she been, she like, ""I'm outside, and I'm single"" (It's up)
So you know I spinned the block (Shot my shot), like we do opps
When it's soft, she get it rock
Wake up, fuck, then go shop (Splurge)
And I don't care 'bout who had it before me, it's my go (My turn)
They droppin' salt like, ""She a ho,"" so, she my ho
If I violate first, no doubt, she gon' violate worse (It get back)
If it don't work out, I guess it just ain't our time
I'ma probably show you I'm solid first and if the energy ain't right
I'ma show you how easy it is to cut ties, no more tries (Gone)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us

Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

(DJ Meech, lil' bitch)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Them niggas get on y'all ass, y'all play with me like I ain't worse
Tryna gossip up the blogs like y'all ain't said my name first
He a junkie, he ain't shot his gun yet, he blame Percs
Shot a video and had a shootout in the same shirt
What you know about popping out and trying to hit they face first?
They like Smurk, ""Your ass be tripping, better put your case first""
Choking who? I heard them rumors, niggas better play slow
I don't want no niggas who you catch, I want the one I paid for
We on his ass, he in the A, you see how long they stay for
Ain't no hotel room, we pop outside the Hyatt with dracos
Hellcats, they get off any scene, the police chase those
Trolling ass, we shot your homie, we ain't know he can take those
If I say your name, don't post it, opps be on all kind of shit
Ain't got time to watch your page to see if niggas died or shit
I know bitches set you up, literally, niggas dying to hit
In this industry, ain't what it seem, this shit be counterfeit
Ain't no lacking, she say I'm a nigga from the trenches with a accent
Why you asking me who shot your homie, why you asking?
You got my number, you post shit on the 'Gram, you moving backwards
You lucky I don't be doing shit for the 'Gram, you niggas cowards
[Chorus: Lil Durk & Gucci Mane]
Better not believe no rumors, rest in peace to Koopa
I jumped on the school bus and I had brung a Ruger
Always drank an 8th of Act', I never drunk a cooler
They get your location, they might pop outside in Ubers
When his goofy ass jumped in the streets? His ass a hooper
I know this shit don't matter, I took a shower with a cougar
Bring him out retirement, he gon' kill you for that mula
Catch him in the morning, wake him up, that boy a rooster (Go)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
He took it to trial, I tried to tell him it was stupid (I knew it)
They gave him so much time, his knees got weak and he was woozy (Damn)
Watch the shit you say, the feds be listening to the music (Woah)
And they gon' take your lyrics and build a case and try to use it
D.A. dropped my murder, didn't have evidence to prove it (Nah)
I think my house is haunted, yeah, by who? The ghost of Pookie (Woah)
He ain't killed nobody but keep rapping 'bout the shootings (Pussy)
Still ain't got revenge yet but keep making up excuses (Wow)
Cuz done drank so much lean that his gut got big as Gucci's (Lean)
Told him quit while he ahead and don't go out like Whitney Houston (Huh?)
He got caught without it, now they robbing him for his rubies (Woah)
He wouldn't give it up so he got buried in his Cuban (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Better not believe no rumors, rest in peace to Koopa

I'm fuckin' the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I can not respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swervin' through rumors
Avoidin' the trends and duckin' the hoes
I'm duckin' the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors

I reach to the stars on my tippy toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writin' my raps?

You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, ho

I had to block you, but you still gotta watch this shit
'Cause who the fuck rock it like me? No bra, tight tee (Hey)
Slick back ponytail, feelin' like I'm Ice-T (Ah)
You know I suck it good, real hood, when you wake up (Real hood, when you wake up)
You know her head weak if she ain't fuckin' up her makeup
Damn, I can't believe I used to let you fuck me (Let you fuck me)
I'd rather be in jail before a broke nigga cuff me (Ayy, ayy)
[Chorus]
Ladies, love yourself, 'cause this shit could get ugly (Shit could get ugly)
That's why it's, ""Fuck niggas, get money"" (Fuck niggas, get money)
And I don't give a fuck if that nigga leave tonight
Because, nigga, that dick don't run me (Ayy, that dick don't run me)
You better get on your knees and eat this pussy right
Before I have another nigga do it for me
Because dick don't run me, I run dick
Nigga, yeah, you's a bitch (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
Mugler suit in my meetin' (Yeah), Wagyu steak when I'm eatin' (Ah)
Makin' so much money, this nigga dumb if he's cheatin' (Dumb if he's cheatin')
Bitches watchin' and hatin' (Yeah), put that shit in they faces (Shit in they faces)
I'll buy the whole buildin' and keep them hoes in they places (Hey, hey, woah)
He submerged in it (Yeah), like a baptism (Like a baptism)
He hit this water, then he comin' back a real nigga (Ah, ah)
How you want a bitch (Yeah), but don't wanna work? (But don't wanna work)
How you want a bitch that you don't deserve?
I should have listened to my first mind
And told your ass ""No"" the first time (Told your ass ""No"" the first time)
Tried to spare this nigga feelings, now he think he hurtin' mine (Ayy)
You're cheap and I be at work while you sleep (While you sleep)
My pussy is the most expensive meal you'll ever eat (You'll ever eat)
Fuck you, still can't believe I used to trust you (Used to trust you)
The only accolade you ever made is that I fucked you
You a bitch, if you get the chance, I bet you snitch
You'll never get a chance to tell me come and pack my shit (Ah)

Billie Eilish.,Armani White,2022,"BILLIE EILISH. Lyrics[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, fuck a first-class, I'm the pilot
[Verse]
Put it in perspective
Bitch, I got everything I wanted and some extra
I am not the type for turning into a detective
Got two of my own phones, barely even check 'em
Uber Eats the food, I don't call, I just text it
Cashed out on bail, my lil' bitch got arrested
Flexed out my Lexus, no backseats and no besties
I chеcked it, no guest list, so don't text mе
Ayy, two pistols, thirties in the clip, these akimbos
Open hand, smack him in his mitt, bitch, I'm Kimbo
You be throwing cash in the strip
My lil' bitch suckin' dick for the free
I got a bitch, but a bitch ain't got me
I know she trip when I dip, so I creep
These bitches pillow talkin' 'bout me like I'm sleep
But she ain't know this Gen3 was in my motherfucking tee

[Bridge]
Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Propped up, fucking it from the back on an island
Heard they talkin' crazy 'bout my name, now it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back—

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, fuck a first-class, I'm the pilotYou might also like6Embed"
